# Empirica Onboarding Project

Welcome to Empirica! This project walks you through the core workflow.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Session Management** - Creating and tracking AI sessions
2. **CASCADE Workflow** - PREFLIGHT -> CHECK -> POSTFLIGHT
3. **Epistemic Breadcrumbs** - Logging findings, unknowns, dead-ends
4. **Goals** - Breaking down work into trackable objectives

## The Task

You'll implement a simple calculator module with tests. The task is intentionally straightforward so you can focus on learning Empirica, not struggling with code.

## Time Required

- First walkthrough: ~15 minutes
- Just the code: ~5 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Empirica installed (`pip install empirica`)
- Claude Code (or any AI assistant)

## Getting Started

Follow the guide in [WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md).

## After Completing

You'll have:
- A working calculator module
- A complete Empirica session with:
  - PREFLIGHT baseline
  - Logged findings and unknowns
  - Completed goal with subtasks
  - POSTFLIGHT learning delta
- Understanding of epistemic self-assessment
