## ⚡ Claude Code Quick Start

### What You Do vs What Claude Does

| You Do (Once) | Claude Does (Automatic) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| `pip install empirica` | Runs `project-bootstrap` to load prior learnings |
| Add snippet to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Logs findings as it works |
| Work normally | Runs CHECK gates before risky actions |
| | Saves what it learned at session end |

### Setup (2 minutes)

**Step 1: Install**
```bash
pip install empirica
```

**Step 2: Add to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md**
Copy this to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) or your AI's system prompt:

```markdown
# Empirica - Epistemic Self-Assessment

You have Empirica installed. Use it to track what you know and learn.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Start session
empirica session-create --ai-id claude-code --output json

# Before work: What do I know?
empirica preflight-submit -

# After work: What did I learn?
empirica postflight-submit -
```

## Core Vectors (0.0-1.0)
- **know**: Domain knowledge (0.7+ = ready)
- **uncertainty**: Doubt level (0.35- = ready)
- **context**: Information access
- **do**: Execution capability

## Log As You Work
```bash
empirica finding-log --finding "Discovered X" --impact 0.7
empirica unknown-log --unknown "Need to investigate Y"
```

## When Uncertain
Run CHECK gate: `empirica check-submit -`

Full docs: `empirica --help`
```

**Full setup guide:** [CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md](docs/guides/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) (hooks, MCP, troubleshooting)
**Full system prompt:** [CLAUDE.md](docs/system-prompts/CLAUDE.md) | [CANONICAL_CORE.md](docs/system-prompts/CANONICAL_CORE.md)

### Step 3: (Optional) MCP for Claude Desktop
Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "empirica": {
      "command": "empirica-mcp",
      "env": { "EMPIRICA_AI_ID": "claude-desktop" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker
```bash
docker pull nubaeon/empirica:1.2.3
```

### How It Works Day-to-Day

**You don't need to type Empirica commands.** Just talk to Claude normally:

| You Say (Natural Language) | Claude Does (Behind the Scenes) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "Continue working on the auth refactor" | Runs `project-bootstrap` → loads what it learned last session |
| "I'm not sure about this approach" | Runs `check-submit` → assesses if it knows enough to proceed |
| "Good work, let's wrap up" | Runs `postflight-submit` → saves learnings for next time |

**What is `project-bootstrap`?**

When Claude starts a session, `project-bootstrap` loads ~800 tokens of structured context:
```
📊 Epistemic State: know=0.85, uncertainty=0.15
🎯 Active Goals: Refactor auth module (in_progress)
💡 Recent Findings: "Auth uses JWT with 15min expiry"
❓ Open Unknowns: "Token rotation mechanism unclear"
```

This replaces 200k tokens of conversation history with just the important bits.

**Will Claude ignore the commands?**

Sometimes, especially mid-task. But after a memory compact (when context summarizes), Claude naturally looks for context—that's when bootstrap shines. The CLAUDE.md instructions make this reliable.

## What is Empirica?

**Empirica is an epistemic self-awareness framework for AI agents** that enables genuine self-assessment, systematic learning tracking, and effective multi-agent collaboration.

Unlike traditional AI tools that rely on static prompts or heuristic-based evaluation, Empirica provides **13-dimensional epistemic vector tracking** that allows AI agents to know what they know (and don't know) with measurable precision.

### Core Philosophy: Epistemic Self-Awareness

**The Problem:** AI agents often exhibit "confident ignorance" - they confidently generate responses about topics they don't actually understand.

**The Solution:** Empirica enables **genuine epistemic self-assessment** through:

1. **13-Dimensional Vector Space** - Track knowledge, capability, context, and uncertainty across multiple dimensions
2. **CASCADE Workflow** - Structured reasoning process with explicit epistemic gates
3. **Dynamic Context Loading** - Resume work with compressed project memory
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Seamless handoffs between AI agents

### Key Features

- ✅ **Honest uncertainty tracking**: "I don't know" becomes a measured response
- ✅ **Focused investigation**: Direct effort where knowledge gaps exist
- ✅ **Genuine learning measurement**: Track what you learned, not just what you did
- ✅ **Session continuity**: Resume work across sessions without losing context
- ✅ **Multi-agent coordination**: Share epistemic state across AI teams

**Result:** AI you can trust—not because it's always right, but because **it knows when it might be wrong**.

### Initialize a New Project

```bash
# Navigate to your git repository
cd your-project
git init

empirica project-init
```

### Your First Session

```bash
# AI-first JSON mode (recommended for AI agents)
echo '{"ai_id": "myagent", "session_type": "development"}' | empirica session-create -
```

## 🎯 Core Workflow: CASCADE

Empirica uses **CASCADE** - a metacognitive workflow with explicit epistemic phases:

```bash
# 1. PREFLIGHT: Assess what you know BEFORE starting
cat > preflight.json <<EOF
{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "vectors": {
    "engagement": 0.8,
    "foundation": {"know": 0.6, "do": 0.7, "context": 0.5},
    "comprehension": {"clarity": 0.7, "coherence": 0.8, "signal": 0.6, "density": 0.7},
    "execution": {"state": 0.5, "change": 0.4, "completion": 0.3, "impact": 0.5},
    "uncertainty": 0.4
  },
  "reasoning": "Starting with moderate knowledge of OAuth2..."
}
EOF
cat preflight.json | empirica preflight-submit -

# 2. WORK: Do your actual implementation
#    Use CHECK gates as needed for decision points

# 3. POSTFLIGHT: Measure what you ACTUALLY learned
cat > postflight.json <<EOF
{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "vectors": {
    "engagement": 0.9,
    "foundation": {"know": 0.85, "do": 0.9, "context": 0.8},
    "comprehension": {"clarity": 0.9, "coherence": 0.9, "signal": 0.85, "density": 0.8},
    "execution": {"state": 0.9, "change": 0.85, "completion": 1.0, "impact": 0.8},
    "uncertainty": 0.15
  },
  "reasoning": "Successfully implemented OAuth2, learned token refresh patterns"
}
EOF
cat postflight.json | empirica postflight-submit -
```

**Result:** Quantified learning (know: +0.25, uncertainty: -0.25)

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Epistemic Self-Assessment (13 Vectors)

Track knowledge across 3 tiers:
- **Tier 0 (Foundation):** engagement, know, do, context
- **Tier 1 (Comprehension):** clarity, coherence, signal, density
- **Tier 2 (Execution):** state, change, completion, impact
- **Meta:** uncertainty (explicit tracking)

### 🎯 Goal-Driven Task Management

```bash
# Create goals with epistemic scope
echo '{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "objective": "Implement OAuth2 authentication",
  "scope": {
    "breadth": 0.6,
    "duration": 0.4,
    "coordination": 0.3
  },
  "success_criteria": ["Auth works", "Tests pass"],
  "estimated_complexity": 0.65
}' | empirica goals-create -
```

### 🔄 Session Continuity

```bash
# Load project context dynamically (~800 tokens)
empirica project-bootstrap --project-id <PROJECT_ID>
```

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Coordination

**Spawn epistemic sub-agents:**
```bash
# Spawn a sub-agent for parallel investigation
empirica agent-spawn --session-id <ID> --task "Investigate auth patterns" --depth medium

# Sub-agent reports back
empirica agent-report --session-id <SUB_ID> --findings '[...]' --confidence 0.8

# Aggregate findings from multiple agents
empirica agent-aggregate --parent-session-id <ID> --merge-strategy weighted
```

**Share epistemic state via git notes:**
```bash
# Push your epistemic checkpoints
git push origin refs/notes/empirica/*

# Pull team member's state
git fetch origin refs/notes/empirica/*:refs/notes/empirica/*
```

### 🚦 Sentinel Safety Gates

**Bounded AI autonomy with human oversight:**
```bash
# Check if operation is safe to proceed
empirica sentinel-check --operation '{"type": "code_generation", "scope": "high"}' --session-id <ID>

# Returns: PROCEED | HALT | BRANCH | REVISE

# Orchestrate multi-step workflow with gates
empirica sentinel-orchestrate --workflow workflow.json --session-id <ID>
```

**Gate types:**
- `PROCEED` - Safe to continue autonomously
- `HALT` - Requires human approval before continuing
- `BRANCH` - Spawn investigation before proceeding
- `REVISE` - Modify approach and resubmit

### 🎭 Persona System

**AI identity profiles that emerge from successful patterns:**
```bash
# List available personas
empirica persona-list

# Find persona matching current task
empirica persona-find --task "security audit" --session-id <ID>

# Promote traits based on successful outcomes
empirica persona-promote --persona-id researcher --trait thoroughness --evidence "Found 3 critical bugs"
```

### 📈 Drift Detection & Trajectory

**Monitor epistemic health and project learning curves:**
```bash
# Check for behavioral drift
empirica check-drift --session-id <ID>

# Project epistemic trajectory
empirica trajectory-project --session-id <ID> --horizon 5

# Assess current epistemic state
empirica assess-state --session-id <ID> --include-history
```

**Moon phase indicators for health at a glance:**
- 🌑 Critical (coverage < 25%)
- 🌒 Low (25-50%)
- 🌓 Moderate (50-75%)
- 🌔 Good (75-90%)
- 🌕 Excellent (90%+)
