## What is Empirica?

**Empirica enables AI agents to genuinely know what they know—and what they don't.**

Instead of false confidence and hallucinations, Empirica gives agents:
- **Honest uncertainty**: "I don't know" becomes a valid response
- **Focused investigation**: Spend time where knowledge is weakest
- **Genuine learning**: Track what you learned, not just what you did
- **Calibrated confidence**: Get better at knowing what you know over time

This produces AI you can trust—not because it's always right, but because **it knows when it might be wrong**.

brew install empirica
```

### Chocolatey (Windows)
```powershell
choco install empirica
```

### Docker
```bash
docker pull soulentheo/empirica:latest
docker run -v $(pwd)/.empirica:/data/.empirica soulentheo/empirica:latest session-create --ai-id myagent
```

## ✨ What Can Empirica Do?

### 📊 13-Vector Epistemic Assessment
Track your knowledge state across 13 dimensions:
- **Foundation**: What you KNOW, can DO, and understand about CONTEXT
- **Comprehension**: CLARITY, COHERENCE, SIGNAL quality, cognitive DENSITY
- **Execution**: Current STATE, CHANGE tracking, COMPLETION progress, downstream IMPACT
- **Meta**: Task ENGAGEMENT and overall UNCERTAINTY

**Result:** Know exactly where your knowledge gaps are.

### 🔄 CASCADE Workflow
Epistemic checkpoints for measurable learning:
1. **PREFLIGHT** - Assess what you know before starting (13 vectors)
2. **Work Phase** - Do your actual work (implicit reasoning: THINK, INVESTIGATE, PLAN, ACT)
3. **CHECK** (optional, 0-N times) - Decision gate: ready to proceed or investigate more?
4. **POSTFLIGHT** - Measure what you learned (compare with PREFLIGHT)

**Result:** Measurable learning deltas and evidence-based decisions.

### 🗄️ Triple Storage for Session Continuity
- **Git Notes** - 97.5% token reduction (46 vs 1,821 tokens)
- **SQLite Database** - Full audit trail with queryable state
- **Handoff Reports** - 98% token reduction (~400 vs 20,000 tokens)

**Result:** Resume work across days/weeks without context loss.

### 🎯 Goal/Subtask Tracking (NEW v4.0)
- Investigation tracking for complex tasks
- Log findings, unknowns, and dead ends incrementally
- Decision quality: unknowns inform CHECK decisions
- Continuity: complete investigation history in handoffs
- Use when: high uncertainty, multi-session work, complex investigations

**Result:** Better decisions through systematic investigation logging.

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Coordination
- Create and share goals across AI agents
- Track task completion with evidence
- Transfer epistemic state efficiently
- Collaborate without duplicating work

**Result:** Multiple agents can work on the same project coherently.

### 🔗 MCP Server Integration
21 tools for Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions (Cline, Continue.dev), and more.

**Result:** Use Empirica directly from your IDE.

## 💡 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install empirica

# Create your first session
empirica session-create --ai-id myagent --output json

# Run PREFLIGHT assessment
empirica preflight --session-id <SESSION_ID> --prompt "Your task description"

# View all commands
empirica --help
```

**Note:** "Bootstrap" refers to system prompts (AI instructions), not session creation. Use `session-create` for sessions.
