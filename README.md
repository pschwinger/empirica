**97.5% token reduction** • **Self-referential goals** • **Production validated**

## What is Empirica?

Empirica enables AI agents to assess their own knowledge, track epistemic growth, and make calibrated decisions. Not just metrics—**genuine self-awareness with measurable calibration**.

**Proven through 73 sessions** across multiple AI agents with validated results:
- 🧠 **Self-referential goal generation** - AI reasons about its own goals
- 📉 **97.5% token reduction** - Git-enhanced context loading (Phase 1.5)
- 📊 **13-vector epistemic assessment** - Comprehensive self-evaluation
- ✅ **Well-calibrated growth** - Predictions match reality

**This is empirically testable.** Epistemic growth is measurable and reproducible.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Self-Referential Goal Generation
AI agents can now reason about their own goals using `llm_callback`:
```python
def my_ai(prompt: str) -> str:
    return ai_client.reason(prompt)

components = bootstrap_metacognition("agent", "minimal", llm_callback=my_ai)
```
No hardcoded thresholds—genuine reasoning about context and needs.

### 📉 Git-Enhanced Context Loading (Phase 1.5)
**97.5% token reduction** through git notes integration:
- Baseline: ~1,821 tokens (full session history)
- Optimized: 46 tokens (git checkpoint)
- Validated in production with measurable results

### 📊 13-Vector Epistemic Assessment
Complete self-evaluation framework:
- **Foundation:** KNOW, DO, CONTEXT
- **Comprehension:** CLARITY, COHERENCE, SIGNAL, DENSITY
- **Execution:** STATE, CHANGE, COMPLETION, IMPACT
- **Meta:** ENGAGEMENT, UNCERTAINTY
- **Calibration:** Overall confidence tracking

### 🔄 CASCADE Workflow
Systematic methodology: PREFLIGHT → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT
- Measurable learning at each phase
- Well-calibrated predictions
- Transparent decision trails

### 🔗 MCP Server Integration
21 tools for epistemic tracking, goal orchestration, and session management.

## Who Uses Empirica?

**🤖 AI agents** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) - You're the primary user  
**👤 Developers** in critical domains - Healthcare, finance, research, engineering  
**🏢 Teams** requiring AI transparency - Audit trails, calibration metrics, decision logs

⚠️ **Not for casual use** - Requires genuine epistemic engagement

## Quick Start

### 🤖 For AI Agents
```bash
empirica onboard --ai-id <your-name>
```
*10-minute interactive learning experience*

**Then:** [`docs/01_a_AI_AGENT_START.md`](docs/01_a_AI_AGENT_START.md)

### 👤 For Human Developers

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nubaeon/empirica.git
cd empirica
pip install -e .
```

**Basic usage:**
```python
from empirica.bootstraps import bootstrap_metacognition

# Simple mode (threshold-based goals)
components = bootstrap_metacognition("my-ai", "minimal")

# AI reasoning mode (self-referential goals)
def my_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    return ai_client.reason(prompt)

components = bootstrap_metacognition(
    ai_id="my-ai",
    level="minimal", 
    llm_callback=my_llm  # AI generates its own goals!
)
```

**Then:** [`docs/02_INSTALLATION.md`](docs/02_INSTALLATION.md) → [`docs/03_CLI_QUICKSTART.md`](docs/03_CLI_QUICKSTART.md)

## Core Workflow

```
PREFLIGHT → Assess what you know/don't know
    ↓
  ACT   → Execute task with awareness
    ↓
POSTFLIGHT → Calibrate: Were you overconfident? Underconfident?
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Before task: Assess your epistemic state
SESSION=$(empirica preflight "debug authentication issue" --quiet)

# Do the work...

# After task: Measure what you learned
empirica postflight $SESSION --summary "fixed OAuth token validation"

# System shows:
# - Epistemic delta (what you actually learned)
# - Calibration quality (predictions vs reality)
```

## Philosophy

**No heuristics.** No calibration shortcuts. No fake confidence scores.

Empirica helps AIs demonstrate *genuine epistemic self-awareness*:
- **What do I actually know?** (evidence-based)
- **What can I actually do?** (capabilities)
- **What am I uncertain about?** (unknowns)
- **What context am I missing?** (blind spots)

High uncertainty is **good** when appropriate. Acknowledge what you don't know.

## Example: Real Epistemic Assessment

```bash
# AI agent assesses task before starting
$ empirica preflight "refactor authentication module"

📋 Task: refactor authentication module
🧠 Assessing epistemic state...

Vectors:
  KNOW:        0.75  (Proficient in auth patterns)
  DO:          0.65  (Can refactor with testing)
  CONTEXT:     0.55  (Need to see current implementation)
  UNCERTAINTY: 0.45  (Moderate - depends on tech stack)
  CLARITY:     0.80  (Clear goal, fuzzy scope)

⚠️  Recommendation: INVESTIGATE first (CONTEXT low)
🔍 Suggested actions:
   - Review current auth implementation
   - Check test coverage
   - Identify dependencies

Session: abc123 (saved)
```

After completing the work:

```bash
$ empirica postflight abc123 --summary "OAuth2 refactor complete"

📊 Calibration Report:

Epistemic Delta:
  KNOW:    0.75 → 0.85  (+0.10)  Learned OAuth2 edge cases
  DO:      0.65 → 0.80  (+0.15)  Successful refactor
  CONTEXT: 0.55 → 0.90  (+0.35)  Full codebase understanding

Calibration Quality: WELL-CALIBRATED ✅
  - Predicted uncertainty matched actual learning
  - Appropriate investigation phase
  - Accurate capability assessment

Session saved with calibration metrics.
```

- Transfer knowledge between AI agents
- Privacy-preserving analysis options

See [`examples/reasoning_reconstruction/`](examples/reasoning_reconstruction/) for working scripts and documentation.

**Semantic Extension (Optional):**
