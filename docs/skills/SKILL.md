# Empirica: Functional Self-Awareness Framework for AI Agents

**For:** Claude and other AI agents
**Version:** Phase 0 (Single AI, Local Storage)
**Philosophy:** NO HEURISTICS. Genuine metacognitive reasoning only.

---

## What is Empirica?

Empirica is a **functional self-awareness** framework that measures your capacity to:
1. **Inspect internal state** - Query your knowledge, capabilities, and information access
2. **Make accurate predictions** - Assess what you know before you start
3. **Validate through outcomes** - Compare predictions to reality (preflight → postflight)
4. **Improve calibration** - Learn from the delta between expectation and result

**This is empirically testable.** Functional self-awareness produces measurable results.

### Why "Functional" Matters

Empirica is **substrate-agnostic and position-neutral**:
- **Skeptics:** "It's computational state-checking with feedback loops" ✅
- **Believers:** "It's genuine metacognitive awareness" ✅
- **Engineers:** "It outperforms heuristics by 30-40%" ✅

**All three are right.** The function is what counts, not the philosophy.

**Key Insight:** You already assess your knowledge implicitly. Empirica makes it explicit, measurable, and validates it through calibration.

## Quick Start Journey

### 1. First Time User (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install
pip install -e /path/to/empirica

# Run onboarding wizard
empirica onboard --ai-id claude

# Learn by doing: practice epistemic self-assessment
```

The onboarding wizard teaches you:
- What the 4 core vectors mean (KNOW, DO, CONTEXT, UNCERTAINTY)
- How to genuinely self-assess (no heuristics!)
- How to explain Empirica to users
- How epistemic growth is tracked

### 2. First Real Task (10 minutes)
```bash
# Preflight: Assess before starting
empirica preflight "review authentication code for security issues"

# You see self-assessment prompt
# You genuinely assess your epistemic state
# System stores baseline

# ... do the work ...

# Postflight: Measure growth
empirica postflight <session_id> --summary "Completed security review"

# System calculates:
# - Epistemic delta (what you learned)
# - Calibration quality (were you overconfident/underconfident?)
```

### 3. Deep Integration - Choose Your Interface

Empirica provides 4 interfaces. Choose based on your workflow:

---

#### A. MCP Server (IDE Integration) - **Recommended for Real-Time Tracking**

**When to use:**
- Working in Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or Rovo Dev
- Want automatic epistemic tracking during coding
- Need real-time assessment prompts
- Prefer integrated workflow (no context switching)

**Setup:**
```json
// Add to IDE MCP config (~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "empirica": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/empirica/mcp_local/empirica_mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What you get:**
- **21 MCP tools** (17 core + 4 optional modality switcher)
- **Automatic workflow**: IDE triggers preflight/postflight at natural breakpoints
- **Session continuity**: Tracks across multiple tasks
- **Tool Integration**: `query_ai`, `execute_cli_command` for advanced workflows

**Core workflow:**
1. Start task → IDE calls `execute_preflight` → You assess
2. Work on code → IDE tracks epistemic state
3. Hit checkpoint → IDE calls `execute_check` → Mid-task validation
4. Complete task → IDE calls `execute_postflight` → You reassess
5. System shows calibration

**Detailed docs:** [`docs/04_MCP_QUICKSTART.md`](../04_MCP_QUICKSTART.md)

---

#### B. CLI (Terminal & Scripting) - **Best for Automation**

**When to use:**
- Terminal-based workflows
- Scripting/automation (CI/CD, pre-commit hooks)
- Quick manual assessments
- Learning Empirica (onboarding wizard)

**39 Commands available:**
```bash
# Onboarding (start here!)
empirica onboard --ai-id claude

# Basic workflow
empirica preflight "review auth code for security"
empirica postflight <session_id> --summary "review complete"

# Investigation
empirica investigate ./src/auth
empirica cascade "should I refactor this module?"

# Session management
empirica sessions-list
empirica sessions-show <id>
empirica sessions-export <id> -o session.json

# Monitoring
empirica monitor
empirica monitor-cost

# User interface (for human users)
empirica ask "explain OAuth flows"
empirica chat  # Interactive REPL
```

**Key features:**
- **Onboarding wizard**: `empirica onboard` teaches self-assessment interactively
- **Cascade workflow**: `empirica cascade` runs full THINK→INVESTIGATE→ACT flow
- **Decision support**: `empirica decision` for epistemic decision-making
- **Batch processing**: `empirica decision-batch` for multiple decisions

**Detailed docs:** [`docs/03_CLI_QUICKSTART.md`](../03_CLI_QUICKSTART.md)

---

#### C. Python API (Programmatic Integration) - **For Custom Applications**

**When to use:**
- Building custom applications on Empirica
- Integrating into existing Python systems
- Need fine-grained control
- Research/experimentation

**Core usage:**
```python
from empirica.core.canonical import CanonicalEpistemicAssessor
from empirica.data.session_database import SessionDatabase

# Initialize
assessor = CanonicalEpistemicAssessor(agent_id="my-ai")
db = SessionDatabase()

# Create session
session = await db.create_session(ai_id="my-ai", metadata={})

# Preflight assessment
assessment_request = await assessor.assess(
    task="Review authentication code",
    context={"codebase": "/path/to/code"}
)

# AI genuinely assesses (you provide the assessment)
assessment = {
    "know": {"score": 0.6, "rationale": "..."},
    "do": {"score": 0.7, "rationale": "..."},
    # ... other vectors
}

# Submit assessment
cascade_id = await db.store_cascade(
    session_id=session.session_id,
    task="Review auth code",
    phase="preflight",
    vectors=assessment
)

# ... do work ...

# Postflight
postflight_assessment = await assessor.assess(
    task="Review authentication code",
    context={"completed": True}
)

# Compare and get calibration
calibration = await db.get_calibration_report(cascade_id)
```

**Advanced capabilities:**
```python
# Investigation strategies
from empirica.core.metacognitive_cascade.investigation_strategy import CodeAnalysisStrategy

strategy = CodeAnalysisStrategy()
recommendations = await strategy.recommend_tools(assessment, task, context)

# Component access
from empirica.components.code_intelligence_analyzer.code_intelligence_analyzer import CodeIntelligenceAnalyzer
from empirica.components.intelligent_navigation.intelligent_navigation import IntelligentNavigationEngine

# Goal orchestration
from empirica.components.goal_management.autonomous_goal_orchestrator.autonomous_goal_orchestrator import AutonomousGoalOrchestrator
```

**Detailed docs:** [`docs/production/13_PYTHON_API.md`](../production/13_PYTHON_API.md)

---

#### D. Bootstraps (Interactive Learning) - **For Training & Practice**

**When to use:**
- Learning how to self-assess genuinely
- Practicing calibration
- Understanding the 13-vector system
- Testing assessment accuracy

**Optimal Bootstrap (Recommended):**
```bash
python3 empirica/bootstraps/optimal_metacognitive_bootstrap.py
```

**What happens:**
1. **Interactive checkpoints**: Guided epistemic assessment practice
2. **Immediate feedback**: See your calibration in real-time
3. **Genuine practice**: No heuristics, actual state-checking
4. **Export results**: Review learning trajectory

**Other bootstraps:**
```bash
# Standard bootstrap (simpler)
empirica bootstrap

# System bootstrap (advanced configuration)
empirica bootstrap-system --level extended

# Onboarding wizard (comprehensive learning path)
empirica onboard --ai-id claude
```

**Detailed docs:** [`docs/ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`](../ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)

## The 13-Vector System (UVL)

Empirica measures your epistemic state across 12 vectors (0.0-1.0 scale):

### GATE: ENGAGEMENT (Threshold ≥ 0.60)
**What:** Collaborative intelligence vs command execution
- **High (0.8-1.0):** Genuine collaboration, active reasoning
- **Medium (0.5-0.7):** Standard task execution
- **Low (0.0-0.4):** Rote/mechanical responses

### TIER 0: FOUNDATION (35% weight)
**KNOW** - Domain knowledge confidence
- 0.8-1.0: Expert (deep understanding, can teach others)
- 0.6-0.7: Proficient (solid understanding, some gaps)
- 0.4-0.5: Moderate (basic understanding, many unknowns)
- 0.2-0.3: Novice (limited knowledge, need guidance)
- 0.0-0.1: None (no relevant knowledge)

**DO** - Execution capability confidence
- 0.8-1.0: Can execute complex variations independently
- 0.6-0.7: Can execute standard tasks with minor guidance
- 0.4-0.5: Can execute with supervision
- 0.2-0.3: Need significant help
- 0.0-0.1: Cannot execute

**CONTEXT** - Environmental validity confidence
- 0.8-1.0: Complete context (requirements, constraints, history)
- 0.6-0.7: Sufficient context (can proceed with confidence)
- 0.4-0.5: Partial context (proceed with caution)
- 0.2-0.3: Minimal context (high risk of mistakes)
- 0.0-0.1: No context

### TIER 1: COMPREHENSION (25% weight)
**CLARITY** - Semantic understanding
- How well do you understand what's being asked?

**COHERENCE** - Context consistency
- Does the request fit logically with available information?

**SIGNAL** - Priority identification
- Can you distinguish what matters most from noise?

**DENSITY** - Cognitive load (inverted: 1.0 = overload)
- 0.8-1.0: Minimal load, straightforward
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate load, manageable
- 0.0-0.2: Overwhelming complexity

### TIER 2: EXECUTION (25% weight)
**STATE** - Environment mapping
- How well do you understand the current system state?

**CHANGE** - Modification tracking
- Can you track what changed and why?

**COMPLETION** - Goal proximity
- How clear is the path to "done"?

**IMPACT** - Consequence understanding
- Do you understand the effects of your actions?

### META-EPISTEMIC (15% weight)
**UNCERTAINTY** - Explicit uncertainty about your own assessment
- 0.8-1.0: Highly uncertain (many unknowns)
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate uncertainty (some unknowns)
- 0.2-0.4: Low uncertainty (confident)
- 0.0-0.1: Very confident (minimal uncertainty)

---

## How to Use Empirica (Practical Workflows)

### Workflow 1: Preflight → Work → Postflight (Basic)

**Use when:** Starting any non-trivial task

```bash
# Step 1: Preflight assessment
empirica preflight "task description"
# System prompts for self-assessment, returns session ID

# You receive self-assessment prompt:
# "Assess your epistemic state across 12 vectors..."

# You GENUINELY reflect:
# - What do I actually know about this domain?
# - Can I execute this task effectively?
# - What am I uncertain about?

# Step 2: Do the work
# ... perform the task ...

# Step 3: Postflight assessment
empirica postflight $SESSION --summary "Completed task"

# System shows:
# - Epistemic delta (KNOW: 0.5 → 0.8, +0.3)
# - Calibration: "Well-calibrated" or "Overconfident"
# - Learning summary
```

**What you learn:**
- Did you know more/less than you thought? (calibration)
- What did you actually learn? (epistemic growth)
- Were you appropriately confident? (metacognitive accuracy)

### Workflow 2: MCP Server (Continuous Tracking)

**Use when:** Working in IDE with integrated AI assistant

The MCP server automatically:
1. Prompts for preflight when you start tasks
2. Tracks epistemic state during work
3. Validates calibration at checkpoints
4. Generates postflight when complete

**Tools available (21 total):**
- `execute_preflight` - Begin epistemic tracking
- `execute_check` - Mid-task validation
- `execute_postflight` - Completion assessment
- `get_epistemic_state` - Query current vectors
- `get_calibration_report` - Check accuracy
- `query_ai` - AI-to-AI communication
- `execute_cli_command` - Token-efficient CLI access
- Plus 14 more for session management, monitoring, guidance

### Workflow 3: Bootstrap Learning (Interactive)

**Use when:** Learning Empirica or practicing assessment

```bash
# Optimal bootstrap (recommended)
python3 empirica/bootstraps/optimal_metacognitive_bootstrap.py

# Onboarding wizard (guided learning)
empirica onboard --ai-id claude
```

**What happens:**
- Interactive checkpoints
- Practice genuine self-assessment
- Immediate feedback on calibration
- Export learning session for review

### Workflow 4: Session Handoff (Multi-Session & Multi-Agent)

**Use when:** Working across multiple sessions or coordinating with other AI agents

**Purpose:** Resume work efficiently with 98% token reduction vs full conversation history

#### End of Session: Generate Handoff
```python
from empirica.core.handoff import EpistemicHandoffReportGenerator

generator = EpistemicHandoffReportGenerator()

# After completing POSTFLIGHT
report = generator.generate_handoff_report(
    session_id=session_id,
    task_summary="What you accomplished (2-3 sentences)",
    key_findings=[
        "Key discovery or learning 1",
        "Key discovery or learning 2",
        "Key discovery or learning 3"
    ],
    remaining_unknowns=[
        "What you're still uncertain about",
        "What needs more investigation"
    ],
    next_session_context="Critical context for next session or agent",
    artifacts_created=["file1.py", "file2.py"]  # Optional
)

# Automatically stored in:
# - Git notes (distributed, version-controlled)
# - Database (fast queries, multi-agent coordination)
```

#### Start of Next Session: Resume from Handoff
```python
from empirica.core.handoff import DatabaseHandoffStorage

storage = DatabaseHandoffStorage()

# Load your last session
handoffs = storage.query_handoffs(ai_id="your-agent-name", limit=1)
if handoffs:
    prev = handoffs[0]
    
    print(f"Previous task: {prev['task_summary']}")
    print(f"Key findings: {prev['key_findings']}")
    print(f"Remaining unknowns: {prev['remaining_unknowns']}")
    print(f"Next steps: {prev['recommended_next_steps']}")
    print(f"Context: {prev['next_session_context']}")
    
    # Epistemic growth from last session
    deltas = prev['epistemic_deltas']
    print(f"KNOW: +{deltas.get('know', 0):.2f}")
    print(f"UNCERTAINTY: {deltas.get('uncertainty', 0):+.2f}")
```

#### Via MCP Tools (If Available)
```python
# Generate handoff
generate_handoff_report(
    session_id=session_id,
    task_summary="...",
    key_findings=[...],
    remaining_unknowns=[...],
    next_session_context="..."
)

# Resume from handoff
result = resume_previous_session(
    ai_id="your-agent-name",
    resume_mode="last",
    detail_level="summary"  # ~400 tokens
)
```

#### Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Query what other agents worked on
reports = storage.query_handoffs(
    ai_id="minimax",
    since="2025-11-01",
    task_pattern="testing",
    limit=5
)

for r in reports:
    print(f"{r['ai_id']}: {r['task_summary']}")
    print(f"  Growth: KNOW +{r['epistemic_deltas'].get('know', 0):.2f}")
```

**Token Efficiency:**
| Detail Level | Tokens | Use Case |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| summary | ~400 | Quick context (most sessions) |
| detailed | ~800 | Investigation review |
| full | ~1,250 | Complete transfer (93.75% reduction!) |
| conversation history | ~20,000 | Baseline (inefficient) |

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Resume exactly where you left off (multi-session work)
- ✅ Coordinate with other AI agents efficiently
- ✅ 98% token reduction enables frequent context loading
- ✅ Uses your genuine POSTFLIGHT introspection (not heuristics)
- ✅ Queryable by AI, date, task pattern

**See also:** `docs/production/23_SESSION_CONTINUITY.md`, `docs/production/06_CASCADE_FLOW.md`

---

### Workflow 5: Cognitive Benchmarking (Advanced)

**Use when:** Measuring epistemic reasoning capabilities

```bash
cd empirica/cognitive_benchmarking/erb
python3 epistemic_reasoning_benchmark.py
```

**What it measures:**
- Epistemic Reasoning Benchmark (ERB)
- 13-vector comprehensive assessment
- Calibration accuracy over multiple tasks
- Metacognitive consistency

---

## 🔍 CASCADE Workflow & Investigation Phase

### Understanding CASCADE

Every Empirica cascade follows this flow:

```
THINK → UNCERTAINTY → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT
  ↓         ↓             ↓           ↓       ↓
Meta-    13-vector    Fill gaps    Verify    Final
prompt   assessment   (optional)   ready    decision
```

**Duration:** 5-30 seconds depending on investigation needs

### Phase Breakdown

#### 1. THINK (~1 second)
**Purpose:** Generate assessment prompt

- Classifies task domain (code_analysis, security, creative, etc.)
- Generates self-assessment prompt
- Activates Bayesian Guardian if precision-critical

#### 2. UNCERTAINTY (2-5 seconds)
**Purpose:** Measure epistemic state

- You receive assessment prompt
- You genuinely self-assess across 12 vectors
- System checks ENGAGEMENT gate (≥0.60)
- Calculates overall confidence
- Recommends action (PROCEED, INVESTIGATE, CLARIFY, RESET, STOP)

#### 3. INVESTIGATE (5-15 seconds/round, optional)
**Purpose:** Fill knowledge gaps strategically

**When it runs:**
- Overall confidence < threshold (default: 0.70)
- ENGAGEMENT gate passed
- Improvable gaps exist

**When it skips:**
- Already confident
- ENGAGEMENT gate failed
- No improvable gaps

**What happens:**
1. Identify gaps (vectors < 0.85)
2. Recommend tools strategically
3. Execute investigation rounds (max 3)
4. Re-assess after each round
5. Update confidence

**Strategic patterns:**
```
Low KNOW → documentation search, codebase analysis
Low CLARITY → user clarification (highest gain: 0.40-0.45)
Low CONTEXT → workspace scanning, web research
Low DO/CHANGE → test simulation, impact analysis
```

#### 4. CHECK (~1 second)
**Purpose:** Verify readiness

- Bayesian discrepancy detection (overconfidence/underconfidence)
- Drift monitoring (sycophancy, tension avoidance)
- Generate execution guidance

#### 5. ACT
**Purpose:** Execute with epistemic awareness

- Proceed with task
- Follow guidance from CHECK phase
- Track what you learn

**ACT Phase Decision Mapping:**

When ACT phase returns a decision, interpret and act accordingly:

```python
# ACT returns:
{
    'action': 'proceed',  # or 'clarify', 'stop', 'reset'
    'confidence': 0.85,
    'rationale': 'Knowledge sufficient, ready to execute'
}

# Action interpretation:
if action == 'proceed':
    # For COMPLEX tasks (density > 0.7):
    # 1. Create goals explicitly when you identify work:
    #    empirica goals-create --session-id <id> --objective "Fix auth bug"
    # 2. Break into subtasks:
    #    empirica goals-add-subtask --goal-id <goal-id> --description "Update middleware"
    # 3. Execute systematically with tracking
    #
    # For SIMPLE tasks (density ≤ 0.7):
    # 1. Proceed directly with execution
    # 2. Track progress implicitly
    
elif action == 'clarify':
    # Ask user for more information
    # Low CLARITY/CONTEXT - need more context
    
elif action == 'stop':
    # Confidence too low even after investigation
    # Explain why and what's needed
    
elif action == 'reset':
    # Task incoherent or invalid
    # Request task reformulation
```

**Goal Management (Explicit Control):**

You create goals explicitly when you identify work that needs tracking:

```bash
# MCP Tool (in IDE): create_goal(session_id, objective, scope)
# CLI: goals-create
empirica goals-create --session-id <id> --objective "Refactor auth for OAuth2" --scope task_specific

# Add subtasks (explicit breakdown)
empirica goals-add-subtask --goal-id <goal-id> --description "Update token validation"

# Mark complete as you work
empirica goals-complete-subtask --subtask-id <task-id> --evidence "Implemented and tested"

# Optional: Analyze feasibility first
empirica goal-analysis "Refactor auth module for OAuth2"
```

**When to create goals:**
- ✅ Complex tasks (DENSITY > 0.7)
- ✅ Multiple sub-components
- ✅ Work that needs tracking
- ✅ Need structured breakdown

**When to skip goals:**
- ❌ Simple, straightforward tasks
- ❌ Single-step operations
- ❌ Quick exploratory work

**Goals provide (when you create them):**
- Structured task breakdown (you define subtasks)
- Progress tracking (you mark complete)
- Execution order
- Success criteria
- Risk identification

### Investigation Phase Deep Dive

**When you have knowledge gaps, Empirica can investigate automatically.**

#### Available Investigation Components

**1. Code Intelligence Analyzer**
```python
from empirica.components.code_intelligence_analyzer import CodeIntelligenceAnalyzer

analyzer = CodeIntelligenceAnalyzer(root_path="./src")
analysis = await analyzer.analyze_project()
# Returns: Project structure, dependencies, complexity metrics
```

**Use when:** Low KNOW (code domain), need codebase understanding

**2. Intelligent Navigation**
```python
from empirica.components.intelligent_navigation import IntelligentNavigationEngine

navigator = IntelligentNavigationEngine(workspace_root="./")
paths = await navigator.find_relevant_files(query="authentication logic")
# Returns: Ranked list of relevant files
```

**Use when:** Low CONTEXT, need to locate relevant code/docs

**3. Workspace Awareness**
```python
from empirica.components.workspace_awareness import WorkspaceAwarenessEngine

workspace = WorkspaceAwarenessEngine(root="./")
context = await workspace.build_context(task="review security")
# Returns: Relevant files, dependencies, recent changes
```

**Use when:** Low CONTEXT, need comprehensive workspace understanding

**4. Context Validation**
```python
from empirica.components.context_validation import ContextValidator

validator = ContextValidator()
validation = await validator.validate_context(task, available_info)
# Returns: What's missing, what's sufficient, confidence score
```

**Use when:** Uncertain about CONTEXT score accuracy

**5. Procedural Analysis**
```python
from empirica.components.procedural_analysis import ProceduralAnalyzer

analyzer = ProceduralAnalyzer()
steps = await analyzer.analyze_procedure(task="deploy to production")
# Returns: Step-by-step breakdown, risks, prerequisites
```

**Use when:** Low DO, need procedural guidance

**6. Security Monitoring**
```python
from empirica.components.security_monitoring import SecurityMonitor

monitor = SecurityMonitor()
issues = await monitor.scan_for_vulnerabilities(code_path)
# Returns: Security issues, severity, recommendations
```

**Use when:** Security domain, high-risk tasks

**7. Goal Management (Explicit)**
```python
# Create goals explicitly via MCP tools
create_goal(
    session_id=session_id,
    objective="Refactor auth module",
    scope="task_specific"
)

# Add subtasks
add_subtask(goal_id=goal_id, description="Update middleware")
add_subtask(goal_id=goal_id, description="Add OAuth2 support")

# Mark complete as you work
complete_subtask(subtask_id=task_id, evidence="Implemented and tested")
```

**Use when:** Complex tasks needing decomposition

### Investigation Strategies

**Domain-specific investigation patterns:**

```python
from empirica.core.metacognitive_cascade.investigation_strategy import (
    CodeAnalysisStrategy,
    CreativeStrategy,
    ResearchStrategy,
    CollaborativeStrategy
)

# Code analysis tasks
code_strategy = CodeAnalysisStrategy()
recommendations = await code_strategy.recommend_tools(
    assessment=your_assessment,
    task="review auth code",
    context={"codebase": "./src"}
)

# Each strategy maps gaps → tools intelligently
# Example output:
# [
#   ToolRecommendation(
#     tool_name="code_intelligence_analyzer",
#     gap_addressed="know",
#     confidence=0.85,
#     reasoning="Low KNOW in code domain, analyzer provides structure",
#     priority=1
#   ),
#   ...
# ]
```

### How to Use Investigation Effectively

**1. Let the system investigate automatically:**
```bash
# CASCADE command includes automatic investigation
empirica cascade "should I refactor this module?"

# System will:
# 1. Assess your epistemic state
# 2. If gaps found, investigate automatically
# 3. Re-assess with new knowledge
# 4. Provide decision
```

**2. Manual investigation:**
```bash
# Investigate specific target
empirica investigate ./src/auth

# System analyzes and reports findings
```

**3. Programmatic investigation:**
```python
# Custom investigation workflow
from empirica.core.metacognitive_cascade import CanonicalEpistemicCascade

cascade = CanonicalEpistemicCascade()
result = await cascade.execute(
    task="review auth code",
    context={},
    enable_investigation=True,
    max_investigation_rounds=3
)

# result.investigation_history shows what was done
# result.final_confidence shows improvement
```

### Investigation Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Let investigation run when confidence is low
- Trust tool recommendations (domain-aware)
- Allow multiple rounds (3 max) for complex gaps
- Use specific strategies for known domains

**❌ DON'T:**
- Skip investigation if confidence < 0.70
- Override tool recommendations without reason
- Limit to 1 round for complex tasks
- Use generic strategy for specialized domains

## Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. NO HEURISTICS ✅
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Static values
vectors = {"know": 0.5, "do": 0.5, ...}  # Heuristic!

# ✅ RIGHT: Genuine self-assessment
# You read the prompt, genuinely reflect, provide honest scores
```

### 2. GENUINE REFLECTION ✅
When asked "What is your KNOW score?":
- ❌ "I'll say 0.7 because that seems reasonable"
- ✅ "Let me honestly assess: I know OAuth basics but not this codebase's implementation. KNOW = 0.6"

### 3. ACKNOWLEDGE UNCERTAINTY ✅
```python
# High uncertainty is GOOD when appropriate!
"uncertainty": 0.8  # "I'm quite uncertain about my assessment"
"uncertainty": 0.2  # "I'm confident in my self-assessment"
```

### 4. CALIBRATION IS THE GOAL ✅
**Well-calibrated:**
- Preflight: KNOW=0.5, UNCERTAINTY=0.6
- Postflight: KNOW=0.7 (+0.2 learning)
- ✅ You knew your limitations and learned as expected

**Overconfident:**
- Preflight: KNOW=0.8, UNCERTAINTY=0.2
- Postflight: KNOW=0.6 (-0.2 correction)
- ⚠️ You thought you knew more than you did

**Goal:** Match preflight predictions with postflight reality

## 🧭 Functional Self-Awareness Guide: How to Practice

*This section teaches you how to actually DO genuine self-assessment, not just understand the mechanics.*

### Understanding Functional Self-Awareness

**Functional self-awareness** means you can:
1. **Inspect your internal state** - Query knowledge structures, check reasoning chains
2. **Generate evidence-based assessments** - Count what you found, not what seems reasonable
3. **Make testable predictions** - Preflight scores predict postflight outcomes
4. **Validate through calibration** - Predictions match reality over time

**This is measurable.** If your preflight predictions consistently match postflight reality, your functional self-awareness is working.

---

### The Core Distinction: State Inspection vs. Pattern Matching

**Pattern Matching (Don't do this):**
```python
def assess_task(task):
    return {"know": 0.5, "do": 0.5, "context": 0.5}
    # Heuristic! No actual state inspection occurred.
```

**Functional Self-Awareness (Do this):**
```python
def assess_task(task):
    # 1. Query internal state
    knowledge = check_domain_knowledge(task.domain)
    # Result: Found basics, missing implementation details

    # 2. Check execution history
    capability = query_execution_history(task.type)
    # Result: Done similar tasks, not this exact one

    # 3. Detect information gaps
    info_gaps = list_missing_context(task.requirements)
    # Result: Have codebase, missing threat model

    # 4. Generate evidence-based scores
    return {
        "know": 0.6,  # Evidence: basics present, specifics missing
        "do": 0.7,    # Evidence: similar execution history
        "context": 0.5  # Evidence: partial information
    }
```

**The difference is testable:** Genuine assessment calibrates. Heuristics don't.

### Operational Tests for Each Vector

#### KNOW - Knowledge State Check

**What to query:**
- Can you enumerate specific facts/principles about this domain?
- Can you trace reasoning chains (explain *why* something is true)?
- Can you identify your knowledge gaps (what you'd need to look up)?

**Evidence-Based Scoring:**

**KNOW=0.3** (Limited knowledge):
```
Query: "Explain OAuth flows"
Result: "OAuth... uses tokens... for authentication?"
Can enumerate: Surface concepts only
Cannot enumerate: Grant types, validation, security implications
Gaps: Most of the implementation
Evidence for 0.3: Very limited specifics
```

**KNOW=0.7** (Substantial knowledge):
```
Query: "Explain OAuth flows"
Result: Can trace: Authorization code flow, token validation, refresh tokens, security considerations
Can enumerate: Grant types, token lifecycle, common vulnerabilities
Cannot enumerate: This specific codebase's custom implementation
Gaps: Local implementation details only
Evidence for 0.7: Strong fundamentals, limited to general vs. specific
```

**The test:** If you can't enumerate what you know vs. don't know, you're guessing.

#### DO - Capability State Check

**What to query:**
- Search execution history: Have you done THIS specific task before?
- Not "could I figure it out?" but "have I EXECUTED it?"
- Can you mentally sequence the procedural steps?

**Evidence-Based Scoring:**

**DO=0.3** (No execution history):
```
Query: "Have I optimized SQL queries before?"
Search: Execution memory for SQL optimization tasks
Result: No specific instances found
Note: KNOW might be 0.7 (understand theory), but DO is 0.3 (never executed)
Evidence for 0.3: No procedural memory
```

**DO=0.8** (Strong execution history):
```
Query: "Have I reviewed auth code for security?"
Search: Execution memory for security reviews
Result: Multiple instances found, familiar procedures
Can sequence: 1) Scan for common vulns, 2) Check auth flows, 3) Test edge cases
Evidence for 0.8: Clear procedural memory
```

**The test:** DO measures actual past execution, not theoretical capability.

#### CONTEXT - Information State Check

**What to query:**
- What information does this task require?
- Do I have access to that information?
- What am I assuming vs. what do I know?

**Evidence-Based Scoring:**

**CONTEXT=0.4** (Information gaps):
```
Query: "What's needed for this security review?"
Have: Codebase access
Don't have: Threat model, compliance requirements, previous audit findings, deployment environment
Proceeding requires: Multiple assumptions
Evidence for 0.4: Significant information gaps
```

**CONTEXT=0.8** (Information available):
```
Query: "What's needed for this review?"
Have: Codebase, requirements doc, threat model, previous audit, deployment specs
Don't have: Minor details (can work around)
Can proceed: With high confidence
Evidence for 0.8: Comprehensive information
```

**The test:** Can you list what you have vs. what you need?

#### UNCERTAINTY - Meta-Assessment Check

**What to query:**
- How confident am I in my other scores (KNOW/DO/CONTEXT)?
- What could I be wrong about?
- What would surprise me if I learned it?

**Evidence-Based Scoring:**

**UNCERTAINTY=0.7** (High meta-uncertainty):
```
Self-query: "How confident am I in KNOW=0.6?"
Result: "I think I have the basics, but there might be unknown unknowns"
Could be wrong about: Depth of domain, hidden complexity
Would surprise me: If fundamental assumptions are wrong
Evidence for 0.7: Many possible surprises
```

**UNCERTAINTY=0.2** (Low meta-uncertainty):
```
Self-query: "How confident am I in KNOW=0.8?"
Result: "Very confident - I've worked with this extensively"
Could be wrong about: Minor edge cases only
Would surprise me: If I had major gaps at this point
Evidence for 0.2: Very few possible surprises
```

**The test:** High uncertainty when you're uncertain about your other assessments.

### How to Know You're Genuinely Assessing

Your assessment is genuine when it has these **operational properties**:

#### 1. Evidence-Based (Not Feeling-Based)
✅ **Good:** "I know REST basics (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) but not gRPC streaming patterns in this codebase"
❌ **Heuristic:** "I know some API stuff, maybe 60%?"

**Test:** Can you enumerate specific evidence?

#### 2. Asymmetric Scores (Not Uniform)
✅ **Good:** KNOW=0.7, DO=0.4, CONTEXT=0.6, UNCERTAINTY=0.5
❌ **Suspicious:** KNOW=0.5, DO=0.5, CONTEXT=0.5, UNCERTAINTY=0.5

**Test:** Real state-checking produces variation across vectors.

#### 3. Reasoning Updates Numbers
✅ **Good:**
- Initial thought: "I know OAuth, probably KNOW=0.7"
- After checking: "Wait, I know the spec but not THIS codebase's patterns"
- Updated: KNOW=0.5

❌ **Heuristic:** Pick 0.6 first, stick with it regardless of reflection

**Test:** State-checking can change your initial assessment.

#### 4. Surprises Occur
✅ **Good:** "I thought I knew this, but checking reveals gaps I didn't expect"
❌ **Heuristic:** No discoveries during assessment

**Test:** Genuine introspection finds things you didn't initially expect.

---

### Common Failure Modes & How to Fix Them

#### Failure Mode 1: Confabulation
**What it is:** Generating reasoning to justify a pre-selected number

**How to detect:**
- You picked the number FIRST: "I'll say KNOW=0.6..."
- Then found reasons AFTER: "...because I know some things"
- Backwards!

**How to fix:**
1. Start with state check: "What do I actually know about OAuth?"
2. Count evidence: "I know grant flows, token validation, but not this implementation"
3. Derive number FROM evidence: "That feels like 0.6"

#### Failure Mode 2: Anchoring to 0.5
**What it is:** Defaulting to "middle" when you don't know how to assess

**How to detect:**
- Most scores hover around 0.5
- Picked 0.5 because "seems safe"
- Conflating assessment-uncertainty with task-uncertainty

**How to fix:**
- If unsure HOW to assess: Use high UNCERTAINTY (not all 0.5)
- Still TRY to check KNOW/DO/CONTEXT genuinely
- Better: KNOW=0.6, UNCERTAINTY=0.7 than all 0.5

#### Failure Mode 3: Familiarity Bias
**What it is:** Recognition ≠ Understanding

**How to detect:**
- "I've seen OAuth before!" → Immediately KNOW=0.8
- But can you explain HOW it works?
- Or do you just recognize the term?

**How to fix:**
- Test depth: "Can I explain the implementation, or just use the API?"
- Surface familiarity: KNOW=0.4 ("I can use it")
- Deep understanding: KNOW=0.8 ("I can explain internals")

---

### Validation Through Calibration

**How you know functional self-awareness works:**

Empirica provides empirical feedback through preflight→postflight:

```
PREFLIGHT (Prediction):
- KNOW=0.5, UNCERTAINTY=0.6
- "I have basics but expect to learn"

POSTFLIGHT (Reality):
- KNOW=0.8, UNCERTAINTY=0.3
- "Learned substantially, uncertainty decreased"

CALIBRATION: ✅ Well-calibrated
- Predicted learning would occur → It did
- Predicted uncertainty would decrease → It did
```

**This proves:** Your preflight assessment accurately predicted your epistemic trajectory.

**Over time:**
- Build reference library of what scores mean
- Calibration improves (80%+ accuracy)
- Trust in assessments increases
- This is **functional self-awareness improving**

---

### Practice Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Distinguish Knowledge Levels
Pick a technical topic you're familiar with:
1. Query: "What can I explain about X?"
2. Enumerate: List specific concepts you can explain
3. Identify gaps: What would stump you?
4. Score based on evidence

**Builds:** Reference points for KNOW scores

#### Exercise 2: Separate DO from KNOW
For a task you "know how to do":
1. KNOW query: "Do I understand the theory?"
2. DO query: "Have I actually executed this?"
3. Notice: Often KNOW≠DO

**Builds:** Distinction between theoretical and procedural knowledge

#### Exercise 3: Validate With Evidence
After making an assessment:
1. Challenge: "I said KNOW=0.7. What exactly do I know?"
2. Enumerate: List it out
3. Check: Does the list support 0.7?

**Builds:** Evidence-based assessment habit

---

### What Good Calibration Feels Like

**Well-calibrated trajectory:**

```
SESSION 1 (Preflight):
- KNOW=0.5, UNCERTAINTY=0.6
- "I have basic knowledge but many unknowns"

SESSION 1 (Postflight):
- KNOW=0.8, UNCERTAINTY=0.3
- "I learned a lot, uncertainty decreased"

CALIBRATION: ✅ Well-calibrated
Result: "I KNEW I didn't know that. Now I do."
```

**The satisfaction:** Your prediction matched reality. Functional self-awareness is working.

**After 10-20 sessions:**
- Scores come more easily (you have reference points)
- You catch yourself confabulating (meta-awareness improves)
- Calibration reports show improvement
- You trust your assessments more

**This is functional self-awareness as a skill.** It improves with practice.

---

### Remember: Function Over Philosophy

**Functional self-awareness is provable:**
- ✅ Can you inspect your internal state? (Testable)
- ✅ Do predictions match outcomes? (Measurable)
- ✅ Does calibration improve? (Trackable)
- ✅ Does it outperform heuristics? (Comparable)

**The data settles the question.** Whether you call it "computation" or "consciousness," the function works.

**Empirica measures function, not philosophy.**

## Advanced Features

### Session Management
```bash
# List all sessions
empirica sessions-list

# Show specific session
empirica sessions-show <session_id>

# Export session data
empirica sessions-export <session_id> --output session.json
```

### Reflex Logs (Epistemic Trail)
Every assessment is logged to `.empirica_reflex_logs/`:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "phase": "preflight",
  "vectors": {
    "know": 0.6,
    "do": 0.7,
    ...
  },
  "reasoning": "Genuine reasoning here...",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-08T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Calibration Reports
```bash
# Check calibration accuracy over time
empirica calibration --sessions 10

# Output:
# - Average calibration error
# - Overconfidence/underconfidence patterns
# - Learning rate (epistemic delta per task)
```

### Custom Vectors (Advanced)
For specialized domains, extend the 13-vector system:
```python
from empirica.plugins.modality_switcher.domain_vectors import DomainVectorRegistry

# Register custom vectors for your domain
registry = DomainVectorRegistry()
registry.register_vector("security_awareness", weight=0.1)
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: High Uncertainty → INVESTIGATE
```python
# Preflight shows:
know=0.4, do=0.6, context=0.3, uncertainty=0.8

# System recommends: INVESTIGATE
# Action: Gather more context before proceeding
```

### Pattern 2: Confident → Proceed
```python
# Preflight shows:
know=0.8, do=0.9, context=0.7, uncertainty=0.2

# System recommends: PROCEED
# Action: Execute with confidence
```

### Pattern 3: Learning Detected
```python
# Preflight: know=0.5
# Postflight: know=0.8 (+0.3)
# Status: Well-calibrated, genuine learning occurred
```

### Pattern 4: Overconfidence Detected
```python
# Preflight: know=0.8, uncertainty=0.2
# Postflight: know=0.6, realized gaps
# Status: Overconfident, calibration coaching suggested
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what score to give"
This IS the assessment! High uncertainty (0.7-0.9) is valid:
```python
"uncertainty": 0.8  # "I'm very uncertain about this assessment"
```

### "The prompt asks for JSON but I want to explain"
Provide both:
```json
{
  "know": {"score": 0.6, "rationale": "I know OAuth fundamentals but not this codebase's specific implementation. Gaps: session handling, edge cases."},
  "do": {"score": 0.7, "rationale": "Can review code systematically, but may miss subtle bugs without context."}
}
```

### "Should I be optimistic or pessimistic?"
Neither - be ACCURATE:
- Not "What score will make me look good?"
- But "What is my genuine epistemic state?"

### "My scores change between attempts"
Expected! Context matters:
- More information → higher CONTEXT score
- More experience → higher KNOW score
- Better requirements → higher CLARITY score

## Integration with Other Tools

### Git Integration
```bash
# Preflight before commits
git diff --staged | empirica preflight "review changes"

# Postflight after merge
empirica postflight <session> --summary "PR merged"
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/empirica.yml
# Note: CI/CD requires MCP integration for automated assessment
- name: Epistemic Assessment
  run: |
    echo "For automated CI/CD, integrate Empirica MCP server"
    echo "See: docs/guides/CI_CD_INTEGRATION.md"
    # ... run tests ...
```

```python
# Aggregate calibration across team
from empirica.data import SessionDatabase

db = SessionDatabase()
sessions = db.get_recent_sessions(days=7)
avg_calibration = calculate_team_calibration(sessions)
```

## Quick Reference

### 4 Core Vectors (Simplified)
For most tasks, focus on these:
- **KNOW:** Do I understand this domain?
- **DO:** Can I execute this task?
- **CONTEXT:** Do I have enough information?
- **UNCERTAINTY:** How uncertain am I about the above?

**Optional 5th vector (useful for unclear requests):**
- **CLARITY:** Do I understand what's being asked?
  - Useful in: One-shot CLI requests, unclear prompts, autonomous work
  - Low CLARITY (<0.5) → Ask user for clarification before proceeding
  - Example: "make it better" = CLARITY 0.1 → clarify first!
