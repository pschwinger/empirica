# Future Features

This directory contains documentation for features that are **planned but not yet implemented**.

## Purpose

Phantom commands (documented but not implemented) are moved here to:
1. Preserve the design intent
2. Remove confusion from main documentation
3. Provide a roadmap for future development
4. Maintain doc-code integrity in main docs

## Organization

- `PLANNED_CLI_COMMANDS.md` - CLI commands to be implemented
- `PLANNED_APIs.md` - Python/API methods to be implemented
- `PLANNED_FEATURES.md` - Larger features or integrations

## When to Move Features Back

When a feature is implemented:
1. Move documentation from `/future/` to appropriate main doc
2. Add to reference documentation
3. Update integrity analysis will automatically detect it

## Integrity Score

Main docs should maintain 80%+ integrity score.
Features here don't count against the score.
