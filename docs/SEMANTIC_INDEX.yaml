# Usage Examples:
# 
# Query by tag:
#   docs = query_by_tag("bootstrap")  → Returns: PROJECT_LEVEL_TRACKING.md
#   docs = query_by_tag("vectors")    → Returns: EPISTEMIC_VECTORS.md
#
# Query by question:
#   docs = query_by_question("How to create a project?") → Returns: PROJECT_LEVEL_TRACKING.md
#   docs = query_by_question("What are epistemic vectors?") → Returns: EPISTEMIC_VECTORS.md
#
# Query by use case:
#   docs = query_by_use_case("multi-repo-projects") → Returns: PROJECT_LEVEL_TRACKING.md
#   docs = query_by_use_case("onboarding") → Returns: BASIC_USAGE.md, PROJECT_LEVEL_TRACKING.md

# Future Enhancements:
# - Phase 2: Embed each doc in Qdrant using these tags as metadata
# - Phase 3: Uncertainty-driven queries (high uncertainty → load docs with matching tags)
# - Phase 4: Cross-project semantic search
