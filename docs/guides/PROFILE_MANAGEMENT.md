# Profile Management Guide

**Empirica v4.0 - Investigation Profiles for AI Agents**

---

## What Are Investigation Profiles?

Investigation profiles configure how Empirica adapts to different AI capabilities, domains, and criticality levels. Instead of one-size-fits-all constraints, profiles enable **capability-appropriate investigation**.

### The Problem Profiles Solve

**Without Profiles:**
```python
# All AIs get same rigid constraints
MAX_INVESTIGATION_CYCLES = 3  # Too limiting for complex tasks
UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD = 0.3    # Too low for novel domains
INVESTIGATION_REQUIRED = True  # Forces investigation even when unnecessary
```

**Result:** High-reasoning AIs constrained, autonomous agents under-supported, critical domains under-investigated.

**With Profiles:**
```python
# High-reasoning AI (Claude/GPT-4)
profile = "high_reasoning"
→ Unlimited investigation cycles
→ Dynamic thresholds based on task
→ Trust AI judgment

# Autonomous agent (Minimax)
profile = "autonomous"
→ Structured guidance (3-5 cycles)
→ Fixed thresholds for consistency
→ Explicit checkpoints

# Critical domain (healthcare/finance)
profile = "critical"
→ Mandatory investigation
→ Strict compliance requirements
→ Audit trail required
```

**Result:** Each AI gets appropriate support for its capabilities and domain requirements.

## Built-In Profiles

### 1. **high_reasoning** - For Advanced AI Models

**Best for:** Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-4, O1, high-capability models

**Philosophy:** Trust the AI's judgment, minimal constraints

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: high_reasoning
description: Minimal constraints for high-reasoning AI models
investigation:
  max_cycles: -1              # Unlimited
  uncertainty_threshold: null # AI decides
  required_when: []           # Optional
capabilities:
  reasoning: high
  self_awareness: high
  investigation: autonomous
constraints:
  enforcement: loose
  override_allowed: true
```

**When to Use:**
- Complex architectural problems
- Novel domains requiring exploration  
- Tasks where AI judgment is critical
- Research and investigation workflows

**Example:**
```bash
empirica session-create --profile high_reasoning \
  --ai-model claude-sonnet \
  --domain software-architecture
```

### 2. **autonomous** - For Independent AI Agents

**Best for:** Minimax, AutoGPT, agent frameworks needing structure

**Philosophy:** Provide guardrails while enabling autonomy

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: autonomous
description: Structured guidance for autonomous agents
investigation:
  max_cycles: 5
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.4
  required_when: 
    - uncertainty > 0.6
    - clarity < 0.5
capabilities:
  reasoning: medium-high
  self_awareness: medium
  investigation: guided
constraints:
  enforcement: moderate
  override_allowed: true
guidance:
  investigation_prompts: true
  checkpoint_reminders: true
```

**When to Use:**
- Autonomous agent deployments
- Tasks requiring consistent behavior
- Production workflows with validation
- Multi-step processes needing checkpoints

**Example:**
```bash
empirica session-create --profile autonomous \
  --ai-model minimax \
  --domain testing
```

### 3. **critical** - For High-Stakes Domains

**Best for:** Healthcare, finance, legal, safety-critical systems

**Philosophy:** Mandate investigation, maximize validation

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: critical
description: Strict requirements for critical domains
investigation:
  max_cycles: 10
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.2  # Low tolerance
  required_when:
    - always                  # Investigation mandatory
  tools_required:
    - evidence_gathering
    - validation
    - audit_trail
capabilities:
  reasoning: any

```

### 4. **exploratory** - For Research & Discovery

**Best for:** Research tasks, prototyping, learning scenarios

**Philosophy:** Encourage investigation, support exploration

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: exploratory
description: Encourage investigation and learning
investigation:
  max_cycles: 7
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.5
  required_when:
    - uncertainty > 0.7
  encourage_investigation: true
capabilities:
  reasoning: medium-high
  self_awareness: medium-high

- Hypothesis generation
- Discovery workflows

**Example:**
```bash
empirica session-create --profile exploratory \
  --ai-model gpt-4 \
  --domain research
```

### 5. **balanced** - Default Profile

**Best for:** General-purpose tasks, unknown AI capabilities

**Philosophy:** Middle ground between freedom and structure

**Configuration:**
```yaml
name: balanced
description: Balanced approach for general use
investigation:
  max_cycles: 4
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.4
  required_when:
    - uncertainty > 0.7
    - clarity < 0.4
capabilities:
  reasoning: medium
  self_awareness: medium
  investigation: supported
constraints:
  enforcement: moderate
  override_allowed: true
```

**When to Use:**
- Default choice when profile unclear
- Mixed capability AI models
- General development tasks
- When starting with Empirica

**Example:**
```bash
empirica session-create  # Uses balanced by default
```

---

## Profile Selection Logic

### Automatic Selection

If no profile specified, Empirica selects based on:

1. **AI Model Detection:**
   ```
   claude-opus, gpt-4, o1 → high_reasoning
   claude-sonnet → high_reasoning
   minimax, autogpt → autonomous
   gpt-3.5, other → balanced
   ```

2. **Domain Detection:**
   ```
   healthcare, finance, legal → critical
   research, exploration → exploratory
   development, testing → autonomous
   unknown → balanced
   ```

3. **Explicit Override:**
   ```bash
   # Override auto-detection
   empirica session-create --profile critical --ai-model gpt-3.5
   # Uses critical (not balanced) because explicitly set
   ```

### Selection Priority

```
1. Explicit --profile flag (highest)
2. Domain-based selection
3. AI model-based selection
4. Default (balanced)
```

## Using Profiles with Bootstrap

### CLI Bootstrap

```bash
# Explicit profile
empirica session-create --profile high_reasoning

# Profile + AI model
empirica session-create --profile autonomous --ai-model minimax

# Full specification
empirica session-create \
  --profile critical \
  --ai-model claude-opus \
  --domain healthcare
```

### MCP Bootstrap

```python
from empirica.cli.mcp_client import bootstrap_session

# Explicit profile
result = bootstrap_session(
    ai_id='claude',
    profile='high_reasoning'
)

# Profile + domain
result = bootstrap_session(
    ai_id='minimax',
    profile='autonomous',
    domain='testing'
)

# Full specification
result = bootstrap_session(
    ai_id='medical-assistant',
    profile='critical',
    ai_model='claude-opus',
    domain='healthcare'
)
```

### Python API

```python
# ❌ DEPRECATED - Bootstrap classes removed (bootstrap reserved for system prompts)
# from empirica.bootstraps import ExtendedMetacognitiveBootstrap

# ✅ Use session-create CLI or SessionDatabase
from empirica.data.session_database import SessionDatabase

db = SessionDatabase()
session_id = db.create_session(
    ai_id="my-ai",
    bootstrap_level=2  # Adjust based on needs (0=minimal, 1=standard, 2=full)
)
db.close()

# Note: Profiles are configured in empirica/config/mco/ directory
# Use 'empirica session-create --ai-id my-ai --bootstrap-level 2' for CLI
```

---

## Profile Customization

### Creating a Custom Profile

**Step 1: Create profile YAML**

```yaml
# ~/.empirica/profiles/my-profile.yaml
name: my-profile
description: Custom profile for my use case
investigation:
  max_cycles: 6
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.35
  required_when:
    - uncertainty > 0.65
capabilities:
  reasoning: high
  self_awareness: high
  investigation: supported
constraints:
  enforcement: moderate
  override_allowed: true
```

**Step 2: Load profile**

```bash
empirica session-create --profile my-profile
```

### Modifying Built-In Profiles

**Not recommended** - Create custom profile instead to preserve defaults

But if necessary:
```bash
# Copy built-in profile
cp empirica/config/investigation_profiles.yaml ~/.empirica/profiles/

# Edit copy
vim ~/.empirica/profiles/investigation_profiles.yaml

# Empirica loads from ~/.empirica/profiles/ first
```

## Profile Best Practices

### When to Use Each Profile

**high_reasoning:**
- ✅ Complex architectural decisions
- ✅ Novel problems requiring exploration
- ✅ Research and investigation
- ❌ Production automation (too flexible)
- ❌ Critical domains (needs constraints)

**autonomous:**
- ✅ Autonomous agent deployments
- ✅ Consistent production workflows
- ✅ Multi-step processes
- ❌ Highly novel domains (needs more cycles)
- ❌ Critical domains (needs stricter constraints)

**critical:**
- ✅ Healthcare applications
- ✅ Financial analysis
- ✅ Legal/compliance work
- ✅ Safety-critical systems
- ❌ Rapid prototyping (too strict)
- ❌ Exploratory research (over-constrained)

**exploratory:**
- ✅ Research projects
- ✅ Learning new domains
- ✅ Hypothesis generation
- ❌ Production deployment (too experimental)
- ❌ Time-sensitive tasks (encourages investigation)

**balanced:**
- ✅ General development
- ✅ Unknown requirements
- ✅ Default choice
- ❌ Known specific needs (use specialized profile)

### Profile Selection Flowchart

```
Start
  ↓
Is domain critical (healthcare/finance/legal)?

## Profile Impact on Workflow

### Investigation Cycles

**high_reasoning:**
```
PREFLIGHT → uncertainty=0.7
→ AI decides to investigate (no constraint)
→ Investigates until satisfied
→ CHECK → uncertainty=0.2
→ ACT
```

**autonomous:**
```
PREFLIGHT → uncertainty=0.7 (> threshold 0.4)
→ Investigation REQUIRED
→ Max 5 cycles
→ CHECK after each cycle
→ Must reduce uncertainty < 0.4 or hit max cycles
→ ACT
```

**critical:**
```
PREFLIGHT → uncertainty=0.3 (any level)
→ Investigation ALWAYS REQUIRED
→ Max 10 cycles
→ Evidence gathering mandatory
→ Dual validation required
→ CHECK → Must meet strict criteria
→ ACT (with audit trail)
```

### Calibration Expectations

Different profiles have different calibration expectations:

**high_reasoning:**
- Expected calibration: 80-90% well-calibrated
- Reason: AI self-regulates investigation

**autonomous:**
- Expected calibration: 75-85% well-calibrated
- Reason: Structured guidance prevents over/under-investigation

**critical:**
- Expected calibration: 85-95% well-calibrated
- Reason: Mandatory investigation reduces uncertainty

**Track over time:**
```bash
empirica monitor --calibration --profile high_reasoning
# Shows calibration statistics by profile
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Found

**Error:** `Profile 'xyz' not found`

**Solutions:**
```bash
# List available profiles
empirica profile-list

# Check custom profile location
ls ~/.empirica/profiles/

# Verify profile name spelling
empirica profile-show high_reasoning  # Correct
empirica profile-show high-reasoning  # Wrong (underscore not dash)
```

### Profile Not Loading

**Symptom:** Profile seems ignored, using default behavior

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if profile was actually set
empirica session-create --profile high_reasoning --verbose
# Look for: "Profile: high_reasoning loaded"

# Verify profile configuration
empirica profile-show high_reasoning
```

### Investigation Constraints Too Strict

**Symptom:** AI forced to investigate even when confident

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use more flexible profile
empirica session-create --profile high_reasoning  # Instead of autonomous

# Or create custom profile with looser constraints
# Edit ~/.empirica/profiles/my-profile.yaml
investigation:
  required_when: []  # Never force investigation
```

### Investigation Constraints Too Loose

**Symptom:** AI skips investigation when it should investigate

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use stricter profile
empirica session-create --profile critical  # Instead of balanced

# Or lower uncertainty threshold
# Edit profile:
investigation:
  uncertainty_threshold: 0.3  # Lower = more likely to investigate
```
