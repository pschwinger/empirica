## Guide Philosophy

Guides in this directory are **task-oriented** rather than reference-oriented:

- **Guides** = "How to accomplish X" (step-by-step)
- **Reference** = "What does Y do?" (lookup)
- **Architecture** = "How does Z work?" (understanding)

For reference documentation, see [../reference/](../reference/).
For architecture documentation, see [../architecture/](../architecture/).
