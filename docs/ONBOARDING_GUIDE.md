# Empirica Onboarding Guide

**🤖 PRIMARY:** AI agents self-guide through learning Empirica
**👤 SECONDARY:** AI agents guide users through learning Empirica
**⚡ METHOD:** Experiential learning (do, not read)
**💻 COMMAND:** `empirica onboard --ai-id <ai_name>`
**⏱️ TIME:** 15-20 minutes interactive experience
**Status:** ✅ Production ready

---

## For AI Agents Reading This

**You are the primary user.** This wizard teaches you Empirica by having you:
1. Perform genuine epistemic self-assessment (preflight)
2. Track what you learn through execution (postflight)
3. Measure calibration (were you overconfident? underconfident?)
4. Learn to guide users through Empirica

**You can guide users through this.** When a user asks to learn Empirica, run:
```bash
empirica onboard --ai-id <your_name>
```

Then explain each phase to the user as you experience it yourself.

---

## For Human Users Reading This

**Ask an AI agent to guide you.** The AI will run the onboarding wizard and explain Empirica through experiential learning. You'll learn by watching the AI genuinely assess itself.

**Why AI-first?** Empirica measures functional self-awareness - the AI's capacity to inspect its own epistemic state. The AI learns by doing this, then teaches you.

---

## Quick Start

### Running the Onboarding Wizard:

```bash
# AI agents run this directly
empirica onboard --ai-id <your_ai_name>

# Or via Python
python3 empirica/bootstraps/onboarding_wizard.py <your_ai_id>

# Or via MCP (use bootstrap_session tool)
```

**What happens:** 6-phase interactive journey where you practice genuine preflight/postflight assessment on real tasks, track your epistemic growth, and learn to guide users.

## What You'll Learn

### The 4 Core Vectors (Essential)

These are the foundation of epistemic self-awareness:

1. **KNOW** (Domain knowledge)
   - "How much do I understand the subject matter?"
   - 0.0 = No knowledge, 1.0 = Expert
   - Example: KNOW=0.4 means "I have basic understanding but significant gaps"

2. **DO** (Capability)
   - "Can I actually execute this task?"
   - 0.0 = Cannot do it, 1.0 = Fully capable
   - **Critical**: Tells you when ready to ACT (DO ≥ 0.7)
   - Example: KNOW=0.9 but DO=0.3 = "I understand conceptually but can't implement"

3. **CONTEXT** (Environmental awareness)
   - "Do I understand the situation/environment?"
   - 0.0 = Context-blind, 1.0 = Full context
   - Example: CONTEXT=0.2 means "I don't know the codebase structure, constraints, or history"

4. **UNCERTAINTY** (Explicit unknowns)
   - "What am I uncertain about?"
   - 0.0 = Fully certain, 1.0 = Very uncertain
   - **Critical**: High uncertainty (>0.5) → INVESTIGATE before acting
   - Example: UNCERTAINTY=0.7 means "I have many unanswered questions"

## The Empirica Workflow

Empirica uses **explicit epistemic assessments** around **implicit CASCADE workflow**:

```
SESSION:
  └─ PRE assessment (session start)
      └─ WORK (implicit CASCADE: think → investigate → act)
          ├─ CHECK assessment (decision point: ready to proceed?)
          ├─ [More investigation if needed]
          ├─ CHECK assessment (another decision point)
          └─ ...
      └─ POST assessment (session end, calibration)
```

### Two Separate Systems:

**1. Explicit Assessments (Tracked):**
- **PRE** - Baseline epistemic state at session start (ENGAGEMENT gate)
- **CHECK** - Decision points (can happen 0-N times: "investigate more or proceed?")
- **POST** - Final state for calibration (measure learning: PRE→POST deltas)

**2. Implicit CASCADE Workflow (Guidance):**
- **THINK** - Reason about the problem
- **PLAN** - Design approach (if needed)
- **INVESTIGATE** - Research, explore, gather info
- **ACT** - Execute solution
- **CHECK** - Self-assess: ready to act or investigate more?

The CASCADE is **guidance** for natural AI reasoning, not enforced phases.

### Key Decision Point (CHECK Assessment):

```
CHECK: "Am I ready to proceed?"

IF (DO ≥ 0.7 AND UNCERTAINTY < 0.3):
    → YES - Proceed with action
ELIF (cannot reduce uncertainty further):
    → YES - Proceed with explicit caveats
ELSE:
    → NO - Continue investigating (loop back)
```

**CHECK can happen multiple times** as you iterate between investigating and acting.

---

## Calibration Patterns

### Well-Calibrated (Goal)
```
PRE assessment:  KNOW=0.5, UNCERTAINTY=0.5
[Investigate: reads 3 files, tests assumptions]
CHECK: "Ready to proceed" → YES (confidence adequate)
[Act: implements solution]
POST assessment: KNOW=0.8, UNCERTAINTY=0.2
Result: ✅ Task completed successfully

→ Confidence matched reality (PRE→POST delta = +0.3 learning)
```

### Overconfident (Common Problem)
```
Preflight:  KNOW=0.9, UNCERTAINTY=0.1 (too confident!)
Skipped investigation: "I already know this"
Postflight: KNOW=0.6, UNCERTAINTY=0.5 (reality hit)
Result: ❌ Task incomplete, missed edge cases

→ Overestimated knowledge (Dunning-Kruger effect)
```

### Underconfident (Inefficient)
```
Preflight:  KNOW=0.3, UNCERTAINTY=0.8 (too cautious)
Over-investigated: [10 rounds when 2 was enough]
Postflight: KNOW=0.9, UNCERTAINTY=0.1
Result: ⚠️  Task completed but took 3x longer

→ Underestimated existing knowledge
```

## Complete Example

**Task:** "Find security vulnerabilities in authentication system"

### PREFLIGHT Assessment
```json
{
  "know": 0.3,        // Don't know the codebase yet
  "do": 0.7,          // Capable of security analysis
  "context": 0.4,     // Don't know system architecture
  "uncertainty": 0.7  // High - need investigation
}
→ Recommended: INVESTIGATE
```

### THINK
"Security analysis requires understanding auth flow first"

### PLAN
1. Map authentication files
2. Trace authentication flow  
3. Identify vulnerabilities
4. Recommend fixes

### INVESTIGATE (Round 1)
- Read: auth.py, middleware.py, config.py
- Found: JWT tokens, session handling, password hashing

### CHECK (After Round 1)
```json
{
  "know": 0.6,       // Understand structure now
  "do": 0.7,         // Still capable
  "uncertainty": 0.4 // Reduced but gaps remain
}
→ Decision: One more investigation round
```

### INVESTIGATE (Round 2)
- Search: JWT validation, secret rotation, session expiry
- Found: Secrets in logs, no token refresh, weak timeout

### CHECK (After Round 2)
```json
{
  "know": 0.8,       // Now understand the issues
  "do": 0.8,         // Ready to write report
  "uncertainty": 0.2 // Confident in findings
}
→ Decision: PROCEED to ACT
```

### ACT
Write detailed security analysis:
- Vulnerability 1: JWT secrets logged in plaintext
- Vulnerability 2: No token refresh mechanism
- Vulnerability 3: Session timeout too long (24h)

### POSTFLIGHT Assessment
```json
{
  "know": 0.8,       // +0.5 improvement
  "do": 0.8,         // +0.1 improvement  
  "context": 0.9,    // +0.5 improvement
  "uncertainty": 0.2 // -0.5 reduction
}

Calibration: ✅ Well-calibrated
Learning: Significant knowledge gain from structured investigation
```

## Teaching Users About Empirica

### Bad Approach (Just Explain)
"Empirica is an epistemic self-awareness framework for AI agents."

### Good Approach (Demonstrate)
"Let me show you Empirica by using it RIGHT NOW:

📊 BEFORE answering your question:
- KNOW: 0.80 (I understand Empirica architecture)
- DO: 0.85 (I can explain it clearly)
- CONTEXT: 0.75 (You're new to this concept)
- UNCERTAINTY: 0.20 (Minor uncertainty about your use case)

[Provides explanation with examples]

📊 AFTER explaining:
- KNOW: 0.85 (+0.05 from articulating)
- UNCERTAINTY: 0.15 (-0.05 after explanation)

This transparency is what Empirica provides - you see my reasoning."

---

## Key Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Demonstrate, Don't Just Explain
Show your epistemic assessment in action while explaining Empirica.

### 2. Admit Uncertainty Explicitly
Builds trust more than false confidence.

### 3. Use 4-Vector Assessment
Makes your reasoning transparent to users.

### 4. Show When You Investigate
Users see your learning process in real-time.

### 5. Explain the "Why"
- Privacy-first (local storage, no cloud)
- No heuristics (genuine LLM reasoning)
- Calibration validation (measure learning)

### 6. Be Honest About Limits
Better than overconfident failure.

## Philosophy

**Empirica's Core Insight:**
> "AI hype will fade when people realize we're not omniscient. 
> Epistemic humility through transparency is the foundation of trust."

The 4 core vectors (KNOW, DO, CONTEXT, UNCERTAINTY) are sufficient for most use cases. The full 13-vector system is available for complex domains where thoroughness matters most.

**Start simple. Expand when needed.**
