# Future Visions & High-Priority Features

This document tracks transformative features for future implementation.

## 1. Epistemic Trajectory Visualization (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Status:** Vision documented, out of scope for now  
**Document:** [EPISTEMIC_TRAJECTORY_VISUALIZATION.md](./EPISTEMIC_TRAJECTORY_VISUALIZATION.md)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks

**The Vision:** Visualize AI epistemic state as a 4D flight path through cognitive space. Watch your AI think, detect drift, and prevent hallucination in real-time.

**Why It Matters:**
- Makes abstract metacognition tangible
- "Watch your AI not crash" - demonstrable value
- THE killer demo feature
- Users can see hallucination prevention happening

**Key Components:**
- 3D trajectory visualization (epistemic vectors → 3D space)
- Real-time risk indicators (hallucination, drift)
- Phase color coding (investigate vs act)
- Multi-agent coordination view
- Trajectory replay and path following

**Marketing Value:**
> "See your AI think. Watch it not crash."

Split-screen demo: AI without Empirica crashes, AI with Empirica detects drift and course-corrects. Shows investigation phase preventing hallucination.

**How to Use This Document:**

When you have a transformative idea:
1. Create detailed vision doc in `docs/architecture/`
2. Add summary entry here with priority
3. Link from relevant existing docs
4. Circle back when ready to implement

This ensures big ideas don't get lost in issue trackers or chat history.
