# Empirica Prompt Guides - Overview

**Purpose:** Help users get AIs to actually USE Empirica system

---

## 📚 Three Guide Types

### 1. USER_PROMPTS_FOR_EMPIRICA.md (572 lines)
**For:** Users telling AIs to use Empirica  
**When:** AI has Empirica but acts overconfidently  
**Contains:** Copy-paste prompts to trigger Empirica usage

**Quick Examples:**
- "Before you recommend, use empirica preflight"
- "You seem confident - did you investigate?"
- "Don't assume - use Empirica to check"

### 2. AI_EMPIRICA_REMINDERS.md (170 lines)
**For:** AI agents themselves  
**When:** AI needs self-reminder to use Empirica  
**Contains:** Decision trees, checklists, habit patterns

**Key Message:**
- You have Empirica installed
- Don't skip it when uncertain
- Investigate before acting

### 3. Original Methodology Guides (Optional Reference)
**For:** Understanding Empirica principles  
**When:** Want to understand HOW Empirica works  
**Note:** These teach methodology, not tool usage

## 🎯 Which Guide to Use?

**Your Situation:**
- "AI isn't using Empirica" → USER_PROMPTS
- "I'm an AI, remind me" → AI_REMINDERS
- "Understand methodology" → METHODOLOGY_PROMPTS
- "Need quick copy-paste" → USER_PROMPTS (Section: Quick Prompts)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Most Common Need:**
```
Copy from USER_PROMPTS_FOR_EMPIRICA.md:

"Before you make recommendations, please:
1. Use Empirica to assess your epistemic state
2. Run: empirica preflight '<task>'
3. If uncertainty is high, investigate first
4. Then provide evidence-based recommendations"
```

**Paste before any AI task that matters!**

## 💡 The Key Difference

**OLD Approach (our mistake earlier):**
- Create prompts that replace Empirica
- Teach AIs to self-assess without tools
- Reinvent what Empirica already does

**CORRECT Approach (these guides):**
- Prompts that make AIs USE Empirica
- Leverage existing tools (MCP/CLI/Skills)
- Trigger the actual system

**These guides get AIs to use Empirica, not bypass it!**

## 📊 Expected Results

**When AI Uses Empirica Properly:**
1. ✅ Runs preflight before recommending
2. ✅ Acknowledges uncertainty explicitly
3. ✅ Investigates when UNCERTAINTY > 0.60
4. ✅ Cites specific evidence
5. ✅ Measures calibration with postflight
6. ✅ Prevents overconfident mistakes

**Success = AI uses the actual Empirica system!**
