## ⏳ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Priority 1)
- [ ] Register adapter in PluginRegistry
  ```python
  registry = PluginRegistry()
  registry.register('minimax', MinimaxAdapter, MINIMAX_METADATA)
  ```

- [ ] Test with PersonaEnforcer
  - Verify persona enforcement works with MiniMax responses
  - Check vector_references validation
  - Test response schema compliance

- [ ] Add to modality switcher default config
  ```python
  switcher.register_adapter('minimax', MinimaxAdapter, tier=2)
  ```

### Short-term (Priority 2)
- [ ] Integration with CLI commands
  - Add minimax option to `empirica cascade` command
  - Add minimax option to decision analysis commands
  - Test CLI integration end-to-end

- [ ] Add to MCP server
  - Update empirica_mcp_server.py to include minimax
  - Test MCP tool calls with minimax backend
  - Verify JSON response handling

- [ ] Create usage examples
  - Simple query example
  - Complex reasoning example
  - Error handling example
  - Integration with other Empirica components

### Medium-term (Priority 3)
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - Profile API call latency
  - Implement caching if beneficial
  - Optimize token usage

- [ ] Enhanced error recovery
  - Implement exponential backoff for rate limits
  - Add retry logic with configurable attempts
  - Better fallback handling

- [ ] Monitoring and logging
  - Add structured logging for production
  - Track success/failure rates
  - Monitor API usage and costs

### Long-term (Phase 2)
- [ ] Structured prompting
  - Design system prompt for epistemic vector extraction
  - Test accuracy vs heuristic approach
  - Measure impact on response quality

- [ ] JSON mode integration
  - Check if MiniMax supports JSON response mode
  - Implement structured output parsing
  - Validate against schema

- [ ] Meta-reasoning
  - Implement second LLM call for vector extraction
  - Compare accuracy with heuristic approach
  - Measure added latency

- [ ] Calibration system
  - Collect feedback on adapter decisions
  - Train calibration model
  - Improve heuristic weights based on data

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Run full test suite (unit + live)
- [ ] Test with PersonaEnforcer
- [ ] Test with ModalitySwitcher
- [ ] Test error scenarios (rate limit, auth failure, timeout)

- [ ] Check environment variable handling
- [ ] Validate API key security

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with real Empirica CLI commands
