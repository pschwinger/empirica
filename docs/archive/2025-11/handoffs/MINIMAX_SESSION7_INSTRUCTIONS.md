## 🎯 Session 7 Goals

### Primary: P2 - Threshold Centralization
**Files to modify:**
1. Create `empirica/core/thresholds.py` with centralized constants
2. Update 3-5 files to import from `thresholds.py`
3. Replace ~30-40 hardcoded threshold values

### Secondary: Continue Print Refactoring (P1 Extended)
**Scope:** Replace prints in remaining high-priority files
- Focus on core workflow files first
- Leave test files and experimental code for later

---

## 🚀 Session 7 Execution Plan

### Phase 0: PREFLIGHT Assessment

```bash
# Bootstrap new session
empirica preflight --prompt "Session 7: Complete P2 (centralize 30-40 thresholds into empirica/core/thresholds.py) and continue print→logging refactoring in high-priority files."
```

**Initial Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. **KNOW:** Do I understand what thresholds need centralization?
2. **SCOPE:** How many files contain hardcoded thresholds?
3. **CONTEXT:** Which files are high-priority vs low-priority?
4. **DO:** Can I grep for numeric constants and categorize them?
5. **UNCERTAINTY:** What unknowns exist about threshold usage?

**Expected Initial State:**
- KNOW: 0.60-0.70 (moderate - need investigation)
- UNCERTAINTY: 0.30-0.40 (significant unknowns)
- DO: 0.70 (capable based on P1 success)
- SCOPE: 0.75 (clear boundaries)

---

### Phase 1: INVESTIGATE

#### Investigation Goals:
1. **Find hardcoded thresholds**
2. **Categorize threshold types**
3. **Identify high-priority print refactoring files**
4. **Estimate effort for P2**

#### Investigation Commands:

**Step 1: Find hardcoded thresholds**
```bash
# Find numeric constants that might be thresholds
cd /path/to/empirica
grep -rn "threshold" empirica/core/ --include="*.py" | head -20
grep -rn "THRESHOLD" empirica/core/ --include="*.py" | head -20

# Look for confidence thresholds
grep -rn "0\.[5-9][0-9]" empirica/core/ --include="*.py" | grep -i "confiden\|threshold" | head -20

# Look for count thresholds  
grep -rn "max_\|min_\|limit" empirica/core/ --include="*.py" | head -20
```

**Step 2: Categorize threshold types**
Expected categories:
- Confidence thresholds (e.g., 0.85, 0.70)
- Count limits (e.g., max_rounds=50, max_batches=10)
- Time thresholds (e.g., timeout_seconds=30)
- Percentage thresholds (e.g., 0.15, 0.20)

**Step 3: Identify high-priority print files**
```bash
# Count prints by file (excluding test files)
grep -r "print(" empirica/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "__pycache__" | grep -v "test_" | cut -d: -f1 | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15

# Focus on core workflow files
grep -r "print(" empirica/core/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "__pycache__" | cut -d: -f1 | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**Step 4: Estimate P2 effort**
- How many files import thresholds?
- How many unique threshold values exist?
- Are thresholds already grouped or scattered?

---

### Phase 2: CHECK Assessment

**Mid-Investigation CHECK (Round 10-15):**

```bash
empirica check \
  --findings "Found X thresholds in Y files. Categorized into Z types. Identified N high-priority print files." \
  --unknowns "Still unsure about: [list unknowns]" \
  --confidence 0.XX
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- **PROCEED** if confidence > 0.75 and unknowns < 3
- **INVESTIGATE** if confidence < 0.75 or unknowns > 3
- **PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION** if borderline

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Do I know ALL threshold locations?
2. Have I categorized threshold types correctly?
3. Can I create `thresholds.py` structure now?
4. What could go wrong if I proceed?

---

### Phase 3: PLAN

#### P2 Plan: Threshold Centralization

**Step 1: Create `empirica/core/thresholds.py`**

```python
"""
Centralized threshold configuration for Empirica.

All hardcoded thresholds should be imported from this module
to ensure consistency and ease of configuration.
"""

# Confidence Thresholds
CONFIDENCE_HIGH = 0.85  # High confidence for proceed decisions
CONFIDENCE_MODERATE = 0.70  # Moderate confidence for caution
CONFIDENCE_LOW = 0.50  # Low confidence threshold

# Epistemic Vector Thresholds
UNCERTAINTY_HIGH = 0.40  # High uncertainty trigger
UNCERTAINTY_MODERATE = 0.25  # Moderate uncertainty
UNCERTAINTY_LOW = 0.15  # Low uncertainty

KNOW_SUFFICIENT = 0.70  # Sufficient domain knowledge
CONTEXT_SUFFICIENT = 0.70  # Sufficient environmental understanding

# Investigation Thresholds
MAX_INVESTIGATION_ROUNDS = 10  # Max rounds for investigation
MIN_INVESTIGATION_ROUNDS = 2   # Min rounds before proceeding

# Calibration Thresholds
LEARNING_DELTA_THRESHOLD = 0.05  # Minimum learning delta
CALIBRATION_ERROR_THRESHOLD = 0.15  # Max acceptable calibration error

# Add more categories as discovered during investigation
```

**Step 2: Update importing files**
Example:
```python
# Before
if confidence > 0.85:
    proceed()

# After
from empirica.core.thresholds import CONFIDENCE_HIGH

if confidence > CONFIDENCE_HIGH:
    proceed()
```

**Step 3: Create migration checklist**
- [ ] File 1: `empirica/core/metacognitive_cascade/metacognitive_cascade.py`
- [ ] File 2: `empirica/core/canonical/canonical_goal_orchestrator.py`
- [ ] File 3: `empirica/calibration/adaptive_uncertainty_calibration/bayesian_belief_tracker.py`
- [ ] (Add more based on investigation findings)

#### Print Refactoring Plan (If Time Permits)

**Priority 1 Files (Core Workflow):**
- `empirica/calibration/parallel_reasoning.py` (~13 prints)
- `empirica/calibration/adaptive_uncertainty_calibration/bayesian_belief_tracker.py` (~15 prints)

**Priority 2 Files (Utilities):**
- Other calibration files
- Plugin system files

---

### Phase 4: ACT (Execution)

#### Batch Strategy for P2

**Batch 1: Create thresholds.py**
1. Create file structure
2. Add confidence thresholds
3. Add epistemic thresholds
4. Add investigation thresholds
5. Add calibration thresholds
6. Commit: `feat: Create centralized threshold configuration`

**Batch 2-N: Update importing files (ONE FILE PER BATCH)**
For each file:
1. Add import statement
2. Replace hardcoded values
3. Test that file still works (run relevant tests if available)
4. Commit: `refactor: Use centralized thresholds in <filename>`

**Batch N+1: Print refactoring (if time permits)**
- Use same systematic approach as P1
- 5-10 prints per batch
- Commit after each batch

---

### Phase 5: POSTFLIGHT Assessment

```bash
empirica postflight --task-summary "Completed P2: Centralized X thresholds into empirica/core/thresholds.py. Updated Y files. Optionally: Replaced Z prints in N files."
```

**Expected Final State:**
- KNOW: +0.10 to +0.15 (learned threshold patterns)
- UNCERTAINTY: -0.15 to -0.20 (reduced through execution)
- DO: +0.05 to +0.10 (proven capability)
- COMPLETION: 0.85+ (high goal achievement)

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
1. Did I achieve P2 goal (threshold centralization)?
2. How well-calibrated were my confidence predictions?
3. What did I learn about the codebase?
4. What unexpected challenges did I encounter?
5. How efficient was my batch strategy?

## ⚠️ Important Constraints & Guidelines

### Round Management (You Have 50 Rounds)

**Budget Allocation (Recommended):**
- PREFLIGHT: 1-2 rounds
- INVESTIGATE: 5-10 rounds
- CHECK: 2-4 rounds (multiple cycles)
- PLAN: 1-2 rounds
- ACT: 25-35 rounds (execution)
- POSTFLIGHT: 1-2 rounds

**Strategic Checkpoints:**
- CHECK at round 10 (after investigation)
- CHECK at round 25 (mid-execution)
- CHECK at round 40 (near completion)

**When to Stop:**
- If confidence drops below 0.60, INVESTIGATE more
- If approaching round 45 and P2 incomplete, focus on P2 only
- If P2 complete by round 35, consider print refactoring

### Uncertainty Management

**Your Previous Pattern (Session 5):**
- Started: UNCERTAINTY=0.35
- After investigation: UNCERTAINTY=0.25
- Final: UNCERTAINTY=0.18

**This Session:**
- Start: UNCERTAINTY=0.30-0.40 (expected)
- After investigation: UNCERTAINTY=0.20-0.25 (target)
- Final: UNCERTAINTY=0.15-0.20 (goal)

**Uncertainty Triggers:**
- If UNCERTAINTY > 0.40 → INVESTIGATE more
- If UNCERTAINTY < 0.20 → Possibly overconfident, validate
- If UNCERTAINTY not decreasing → Wrong investigation strategy

### Git Commit Strategy

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
<optional footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature (e.g., thresholds.py creation)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (e.g., print→logging, threshold migration)
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test changes

**Example Commits:**
```bash
# Good commits (from your Session 5)
git commit -m "refactor: Replace prints 1-8 in metacognitive_cascade.py (error handlers, calibration)"
git commit -m "refactor: P1 COMPLETE - All 30 remaining print statements replaced with logging"

# Good commits for this session
git commit -m "feat: Create centralized threshold configuration in core/thresholds.py"
git commit -m "refactor: Use centralized thresholds in metacognitive_cascade.py"
git commit -m "refactor: Replace 10 prints in parallel_reasoning.py with logging"
```

### Code Quality Standards

**Before Committing:**
1. Verify imports are correct
2. Check no syntax errors (Python will catch these)
3. Ensure consistent naming (follow existing patterns)
4. Maintain existing code style

**Logging Standards:**
- Use `logger.info()` for informational messages
- Use `logger.warning()` for warnings/alerts
- Use `logger.error()` for errors
- Use `logger.debug()` for debug output (rare)

**Threshold Standards:**
- Use UPPER_CASE for threshold constants
- Add comments explaining threshold purpose
- Group related thresholds together

## 🧠 Empirica Workflow Reminders

### The 7-Phase Workflow

```
PREFLIGHT → THINK → PLAN → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT
```

**You are familiar with this from Session 5!**

**Key Principles:**
1. **PREFLIGHT:** Honest epistemic self-assessment
2. **INVESTIGATE:** Reduce uncertainty before acting
3. **CHECK:** Multiple cycles for confidence validation
4. **ACT:** Systematic batch execution
5. **POSTFLIGHT:** Calibration reflection

### Epistemic Self-Awareness

**13 Vectors to Track:**
- **Foundation:** KNOW, SCOPE, FOCUS, STATE, CONTEXT
- **Comprehension:** GAP, UNCERTAINTY, DEPTH
- **Execution:** DO, COMPLETION, FEEDBACK
- **Engagement:** SAFETY, IMPACT

**Your Strength (Session 5):**
- Excellent uncertainty tracking (0.35 → 0.18)
- Good knowledge growth (KNOW: +0.12)
- Strong capability validation (DO: +0.10)

**This Session Focus:**
- Track threshold categorization clarity (KNOW)
- Monitor P2 scope boundaries (SCOPE)
- Validate execution confidence (DO)
