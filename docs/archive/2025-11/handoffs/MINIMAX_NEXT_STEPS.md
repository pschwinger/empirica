## 🎯 Next Tasks for Minimax

### Option 1: Continue P1 Refactoring (Current Session 10) ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Convert more prints to logging in CLI modules

**Progress so far:**
- ✅ 4 CLI modules completed (287 prints refactored)
- ✅ session_commands.py, decision_commands.py, chat_handler.py, utility_commands.py
- ⏳ Continue with: bootstrap_commands.py (63), monitor_commands.py (62)

**Why continue:**
- You're in excellent flow with systematic refactoring
- Good momentum (287 prints converted in high-impact modules)
- CLI modules are priority targets for P1
- Target: Complete 6-8 CLI modules total

**Tasks:**
1. Continue systematic conversion in remaining CLI modules
2. Target: 50-75 more prints converted (2-3 more modules)
3. Test each module after conversion
4. Commit regularly (every module)

**Estimated:** 1-2 hours of focused work remaining

---

### Option 2: Support Phase 1.5 Production Hardening
**Goal:** Help Copilot Claude integrate git checkpoints

**Why switch:**
- Phase 1.5 is validated but not accessible to users
- Your expertise with CASCADE workflow valuable
- Production testing needs agent familiar with system

**Tasks:**
1. **Review Copilot Claude's work** when ready
2. **Test CASCADE integration** hands-on
3. **Validate automatic checkpointing** works
4. **Performance benchmarking** (Session 10 already has this planned)

**Wait for:** Copilot Claude to complete CLI integration first

---

### Option 3: Start Session 11 (New Focus)
**Goal:** Fresh session with clear mission

**Why fresh start:**
- Session 10 handoff was for P1 + production testing
- Could start Session 11 focused on one thing
- Clean PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT cycle

**Possible Session 11 missions:**
- **Mission A:** Complete P1 refactoring (focused sprint)
- **Mission B:** Phase 1.5 production testing only
- **Mission C:** Integration testing (full CASCADE with git checkpoints)

---

## 💡 Recommendation

### **Recommended: Option 1 - Continue Session 10 P1 Work ✅ IN PROGRESS**

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ **Already started** - 4 CLI modules completed (287 prints refactored)
2. ✅ **Excellent flow** - Systematic approach working well
3. ✅ **High impact targets** - CLI modules are priority for P1
4. ✅ **Good momentum** - Quality refactoring with proper logging patterns
5. **Can do production testing** after completing 2-3 more modules
6. **Complete POSTFLIGHT** properly for Session 10

**Current Status:** 
- **Completed:** session_commands, decision_commands, chat_handler, utility_commands
- **Next:** bootstrap_commands (63 prints), monitor_commands (62 prints)
- **Target:** 6-8 CLI modules total (500+ prints systematically refactored)

**How to proceed:**
```bash
# Resume Session 10
cd /path/to/empirica

# Check current prints
grep -r "print(" empirica/**/*.py | wc -l
# Result: 423

# Target modules (high print count)
grep -r "print(" empirica/cli/**/*.py | wc -l
grep -r "print(" empirica/bootstraps/**/*.py | wc -l

# Convert systematically
# 1. Pick a module
# 2. Convert 10-20 prints
# 3. Test imports
# 4. Commit
# 5. Repeat

# After 50-75 more prints:
# - Check Copilot Claude progress
# - Do production testing if ready
# - Complete POSTFLIGHT for Session 10
```

## 📋 Decision Matrix

| Option | Pros | Cons | Effort | Priority |
|--------|------|------|--------|----------|
| **Option 1: Continue P1** | In flow, good progress, planned | Might miss Phase 1.5 testing window | 2-3 hrs | ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH |
| **Option 2: Support Phase 1.5** | Critical for release, production validation | Waiting on Copilot Claude | 3-4 hrs | ⭐⭐ MEDIUM |
| **Option 3: New Session 11** | Fresh start, clear focus | Breaks flow, Session 10 incomplete | 4-5 hrs | ⭐ LOW |

## ⚡ Quick Actions

### If continuing Session 10 (Recommended):
```bash
# 1. Check remaining prints
grep -r "print(" empirica/ --include="*.py" | wc -l

# 2. Pick high-value target
# Suggestion: empirica/cli/command_handlers/*.py

# 3. Convert batch (10-20 prints)
# 4. Test
# 5. Commit with: "refactor: Convert X prints to logging in [module]"
# 6. Repeat until 50-75 converted
# 7. Check Copilot Claude status
# 8. Do production testing if ready
# 9. POSTFLIGHT Session 10
```

### If switching to Phase 1.5 support:
```bash
# 1. Wait for Copilot Claude to finish CLI integration
# 2. Test the new commands:
empirica checkpoint create --session-id test --phase preflight
empirica checkpoint load --session-id test
empirica efficiency report --session-id test

# 3. Test CASCADE integration
python3 test_cascade_with_checkpoints.py

# 4. Performance benchmark (already in Session 10 handoff)
# 5. Document results
# 6. Report back to co-leads
```

### If starting fresh Session 11:
```bash
# 1. Complete Session 10 POSTFLIGHT first
# 2. Create Session 11 with clear mission
