# Archive: Wrong CASCADE Model

**Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Reason:** These documents conflate implicit CASCADE workflow with explicit epistemic assessments

---

## The Problem

These documents treat CASCADE as **explicit state machine phases** when it should be:

### Correct Model:
- **CASCADE:** Implicit workflow guidance (think→plan→investigate→check→act)
- **Assessments:** Explicit checkpoints (PRE→CHECK(s)→POST)
- **Calibration:** Measure learning (PRE→POST deltas)

### Wrong Pattern (in these docs):
- "PREFLIGHT phase" → Should be "PRE assessment"
- "POSTFLIGHT phase" → Should be "POST assessment"  
- "Phase transitions" → Should be "Assessment checkpoints"
- Treating CASCADE phases as trackable states
