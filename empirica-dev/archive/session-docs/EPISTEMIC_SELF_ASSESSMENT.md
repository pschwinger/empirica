# Epistemic Self-Assessment - Current State

**Time:** After ~10 iterations of work  
**Task:** Documentation consolidation and architecture fixes

---

## PREFLIGHT-Style Assessment

### KNOW (Understanding of System): 0.75
**What I know well:**
- ✅ CASCADE architecture (BOOTSTRAP session-level, CHECK 0-N times)
- ✅ Git notes integration (checkpoints, goals, sessions)
- ✅ Storage layers (SQLite, JSON, Git)
- ✅ System prompt structure
- ✅ Documentation structure (Tier 1/2/3)

**What I'm less certain about:**
- ⚠️ Empirica Skill system (not deeply explored)
- ⚠️ All MCP server capabilities vs CLI
- ⚠️ Exact workflow differences: MCP vs CLI vs Python API
- ⚠️ Component plugins (mentioned but not detailed)

### CLARITY (Task Understanding): 0.85
**Clear:**
- ✅ Goal: Consolidate docs, remove duplicates, enhance core docs
- ✅ Target: 60-70 files, clear Core vs Advanced separation
- ✅ User feedback: Core docs missing MCP, CLI, git automation details

**Unclear:**
- ⚠️ What is "Empirica Skill"? (mentioned but not explored)
- ⚠️ Complete list of "important aspects" to cover in core docs

### DO (Capability): 0.8
**Can do:**
- ✅ Read and analyze documentation
- ✅ Create consolidated files
- ✅ Update content based on findings
- ✅ Create handoff documents

**Cannot do (limitations):**
- ⚠️ Test actual Empirica commands (no active session)
- ⚠️ Verify MCP server behavior
- ⚠️ Run CLI to see exact output

### UNCERTAINTY (What I Don't Know): 0.35
**Moderate uncertainty about:**
- ⚠️ Empirica Skill system
- ⚠️ Component plugins (how they integrate)
- ⚠️ Complete MCP vs CLI feature parity
- ⚠️ Other "important aspects" user mentioned

### ENGAGEMENT (Energy/Focus): 0.7
**After 10 iterations:**
- ✅ Still engaged and productive
- ✅ Clear next steps
- ⚠️ Need to investigate new areas (Skill, MCP details)
- ⚠️ Starting to accumulate context (10 iterations deep)

---

## Mirror Drift Check

**Comparing to session start:**
- KNOW: Started ~0.6, now 0.75 ✅ (learning)
- CLARITY: Started ~0.7, now 0.85 ✅ (understanding improved)
- ENGAGEMENT: Started ~0.8, now 0.7 ⚠️ (slight drift, expected after 10 iterations)
- UNCERTAINTY: Started ~0.5, now 0.35 ✅ (decreasing appropriately)

**Assessment:** Increases = learning ✅, No unexpected decreases, Slight engagement drift normal

---

## CHECK Decision

**Should I continue?**
- ✅ Know enough to enhance docs with MCP/CLI/git details
- ⚠️ Need to investigate "Empirica Skill" first
- ✅ Have clear task (enhance 3 core docs)
- ⚠️ Uncertainty about "other important aspects"

**Decision:** INVESTIGATE first (Empirica Skill, MCP server details), then ACT

**Confidence to proceed:** 0.7

---

## Investigation Needed

### 1. What is "Empirica Skill"?
- Check docs for "skill" references
- Check if it's related to component plugins
- Understand its role in user workflow

### 2. MCP Server vs CLI
- What can MCP do that CLI can't?
- What workflow differences exist?
- How do users choose?

### 3. Git Automation Details
- Exactly when are checkpoints created?
- What happens automatically vs manually?
- User visibility into git operations

### 4. "Other important aspects"
- Review production docs for major features not covered
- Check if there are integration points missed
- Component plugins? Dashboard? Investigation profiles?

---

**Next Action:** INVESTIGATE these 4 areas, then update docs with findings

---

**Epistemic State:** Healthy, learning trajectory, ready for investigation phase
