# Session Documentation Archive

**Archived:** 2025-01-29  
**Reason:** Session summaries, handoffs, and progress docs are ephemeral. Not part of maintained documentation.

---

## What's Here

~50+ files including:
- Session summaries (*_SUMMARY.md)
- Completion reports (*_COMPLETE.md)
- Handoff documents (*_HANDOFF*.md)
- Status updates (*_STATUS.md, *_PROGRESS.md)
- Investigation findings (*_FINDINGS.md)
- Planning documents (*_PLAN.md)
- Audit reports (*_AUDIT*.md)

These were valuable during development but don't need to be maintained going forward.

---

## Why Archived

1. **Ephemeral:** These docs are snapshots of work-in-progress
2. **Contradictory:** Often contain outdated models/approaches
3. **Maintenance burden:** 50+ docs to keep accurate vs. canonical sources
4. **Confusion:** Can mislead users looking for current documentation
