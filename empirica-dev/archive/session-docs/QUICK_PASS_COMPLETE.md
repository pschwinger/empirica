## What We Added (Quick Pass)

### Files Updated:

1. **docs/production/03_BASIC_USAGE.md**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive "Goal Management & Git Integration" section (~60 lines)
   - Goals with vectorial scope explanation
   - Git notes for checkpoints/goals/handoffs
   - Compression details (85%, 98%)
   - Cross-AI coordination workflow
   - Fixed "12 vectors" → "13 vectors"

2. **docs/production/07_INVESTIGATION_SYSTEM.md**
   - ✅ Added "Context: Investigation in CASCADE" section
   - Two separate systems explained
   - Investigation as implicit (not enforced)
   - Goals & git integration in investigation
   - Configurable thresholds note

### Files Already Good:

- **docs/getting-started.md** - Already has comprehensive git integration (lines 389-428)
- **docs/architecture.md** - Fully updated earlier (goals, git, correct CASCADE)
- **docs/production/00_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - Likely has goals already
- **docs/production/23_SESSION_CONTINUITY.md** - Likely mentions git
- **docs/production/26_CROSS_AI_COORDINATION.md** - Likely has goal discovery

## Quick Pass Results

**Added to docs:**
- Goal management with vectorial scope
- Git integration (checkpoints, goals, handoffs)
- Compression details (85%, 98%)
- Cross-AI coordination workflow
- Two systems clarity (explicit vs implicit)
- Configurable thresholds note

**Still TODO (if wanted):**
- Deep dive: STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md comprehensive update
- Add minimum references to remaining 16 production docs
- Fix remaining heuristic threshold language (48 instances)
- Reinforce "two systems" in more docs

## Session Stats (68 iterations)

### Major Accomplishments:
1. ✅ MCP validation fixed (flexible, not rigid)
2. ✅ Future vision documented (trajectory visualization)
3. ✅ E2E testing complete (15/15 passing)
4. ✅ CASCADE concept clarified (implicit vs explicit)
5. ✅ System prompts cleaned (separation of concerns)
6. ✅ ~100 files archived (200+ → 70 essential)
7. ✅ Core docs fixed (5 files, correct CASCADE)
8. ✅ Guides cleaned (29 → 14 essential)
9. ✅ CANONICAL_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE updated
10. ✅ TRY_EMPIRICA_NOW.md fixed (goals + correct model)
11. ✅ architecture.md comprehensive update (goals + git)
12. ✅ Git integration code audit (verify reality)
13. ✅ Quick pass on production docs (goals + git context)

### Documentation Status:
- **Structure:** Clean (70 essential files vs 200+)
- **Alignment:** Good (correct CASCADE everywhere)
- **Coverage:** Improved (goals + git in key docs)
- **Gaps:** Identified (16 production docs could use minimum reference)

## Recommended Next Session

**If continuing documentation:**
1. Deep dive: STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md (add goals/handoffs/cross-AI)
2. Minimum references: Add one-liner to remaining 16 production docs
3. Threshold language: Fix "MUST/REQUIRED" → "guidance/configurable" (48 instances)

**OR move to code (Step 3):**
4. Refactor metacognitive_cascade.py (remove explicit phase tracking)
5. Update schemas (CascadePhase → AssessmentType)
6. Make CASCADE guidance-only

**Status:** Quick pass complete ✅  
**Production docs:** Key docs have goals + git context  
**Ready for:** Deep dive on storage docs OR move to code refactoring
