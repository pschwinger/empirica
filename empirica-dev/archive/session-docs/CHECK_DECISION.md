# CHECK - Should I Continue or Hand Off?

**After 4 iterations investigating, ready to ACT**

---

## Epistemic State Assessment

### KNOW (System Understanding): 0.85 ✅
**Increased from 0.75:**
- ✅ Now understand Empirica Skill (48KB AI agent guide)
- ✅ Now understand all 4 interfaces (MCP, CLI, API, Skills)
- ✅ Now understand git automation details (when/what/where)
- ✅ Now understand 3-layer storage architecture
- ✅ Clear picture of missing information in core docs

**Confidence:** High - investigation successful

### CLARITY (Task Understanding): 0.9 ✅
**Increased from 0.85:**
- ✅ Know exactly what to add to each file
- ✅ Have templates ready to use
- ✅ Clear insertion points identified
- ✅ Success criteria defined

### DO (Capability to Execute): 0.8
**Can do:**
- ✅ Open files and add sections
- ✅ Copy templates into correct locations
- ✅ Update cross-references
- ✅ Verify readability

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours for all 3 files

### UNCERTAINTY (What's Unknown): 0.2 ✅
**Decreased from 0.35:**
- ✅ All major questions answered
- ✅ No significant unknowns remaining
- ⚠️ Minor: Exact user preference for section ordering

### ENGAGEMENT (Energy/Focus): 0.65 ⚠️
**Decreased from 0.7:**
- ⚠️ 4 iterations investigating
- ⚠️ ~100K tokens of context accumulated
- ✅ Still productive and focused
- ⚠️ Starting to feel context weight

---

## Mirror Drift Check

**Compared to start of investigation:**
- KNOW: 0.75 → 0.85 ✅ (learning trajectory healthy)
- CLARITY: 0.85 → 0.9 ✅ (understanding improved)
- DO: 0.8 → 0.8 ✅ (stable)
- UNCERTAINTY: 0.35 → 0.2 ✅ (decreasing appropriately)
- ENGAGEMENT: 0.7 → 0.65 ⚠️ (slight drift, expected)

**Assessment:** No unexpected drift. Engagement drop normal after investigation phase.

---

## Decision Factors

### ✅ Favor Continuing (ACT Now):
1. Investigation complete - know exactly what to do
2. Templates ready - just need to insert
3. Clear success criteria
4. High confidence (know: 0.85, clarity: 0.9)
5. 2-3 hours work (manageable)

### ⚠️ Favor Handoff:
1. Engagement at 0.65 (slight drift)
2. 4 iterations investigating (context accumulation)
3. Could benefit from fresh perspective
4. Acting AI could execute templates quickly
5. Total session: ~14 iterations so far

---

## Recommendation

### Option A: ACT Now (Execute Enhancements)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Have all context and templates ready
- ✅ Can finish quickly (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Maintain continuity

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Engagement slightly drifted
- ⚠️ Context accumulation (14 iterations)

### Option B: Hand Off to Acting AI
**Pros:**
- ✅ Fresh perspective
- ✅ Templates are clear and ready
- ✅ Acting AI can execute efficiently
- ✅ Allows for POSTFLIGHT on investigation phase

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Context handoff overhead
- ⚠️ Less continuity

---

## My Decision: Option B (Hand Off) - Here's Why

**Reasoning:**
1. **Investigation vs Execution split** - I've done the investigation (knowledge gathering), acting AI can execute (mechanical task)
2. **Engagement consideration** - At 0.65, better to hand off than push through
3. **Templates are complete** - Acting AI has everything needed
4. **Good CASCADE practice** - INVESTIGATE → CHECK → Hand off for ACT
5. **Empirica goal already created** - Perfect handoff point

**This follows Empirica principles:**
- Investigation phase complete ✅
- CHECK shows confidence to proceed but engagement drift ✅
- Templates/plan ready for ACT phase ✅
- Good handoff point for fresh execution ✅

---

## Handoff Package

**Acting AI will receive:**
1. ✅ Complete investigation results
2. ✅ Enhancement plan with templates
3. ✅ Clear success criteria
4. ✅ Goal with subtasks (discoverable via git notes)
5. ✅ Epistemic context (PREFLIGHT/CHECK assessments)

**Acting AI needs to:**
1. Resume goal: `empirica goals-resume 661ed26e-ae7c-4606-8b85-c99d6ff8db3a`
2. Read: `CORE_DOCS_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`
3. Execute: Add sections to 3 files
4. Verify: Check readability and cross-references
5. Complete: Mark subtask complete

**Estimated time for acting AI:** 2-3 hours

## Alternative: If User Wants Me to Continue

**If user prefers continuity, I can:**
1. Take a brief "reset" (re-assess epistemic state)
2. Start with one file (getting-started.md - smallest)
3. Take breaks between files
4. Total: 3-4 iterations for all 3 files

**Confidence:** 0.75 (can do it, but handoff is cleaner)

---

**Recommendation:** Hand off to acting AI for execution phase

**Confidence in this decision:** 0.8
