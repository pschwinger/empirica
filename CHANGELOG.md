# Changelog

All notable changes to Empirica will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **workspace-overview command** - Epistemic project management dashboard
  - Shows epistemic health of all projects in workspace
  - Health scoring algorithm: `(know * 0.6) + ((1 - uncertainty) * 0.4) - (dead_end_ratio * 0.2)`
  - Color-coded health tiers: 🟢 high (≥0.7), 🟡 medium (0.5-0.7), 🔴 low (<0.5)
  - Sorting options: activity, knowledge, uncertainty, name
  - Filtering by project status: active, inactive, complete
  - JSON and dashboard output formats
  
- **workspace-map command** - Git repository discovery
  - Scans parent directory for git repositories
  - Shows which repos are tracked in Empirica
  - Displays epistemic health metrics for tracked projects
  - Suggests commands to track untracked repositories
  - Enables workspace-wide epistemic visibility

### Database
- `get_workspace_overview()` - Aggregates epistemic state across all projects
- `_get_workspace_stats()` - Calculates workspace-level statistics
- Health metrics include: know, uncertainty, findings, unknowns, dead ends

### Dogfooding
- Successfully used Empirica's full CASCADE workflow to build these features
- PREFLIGHT → CHECK → POSTFLIGHT assessments captured
- Learning deltas: know +0.13, completion +0.75, uncertainty -0.20
- BEADS integration tested with 3 issues tracked and closed

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **Improved goals-list UX** - Shows helpful preview of 5 most recent goals when no session ID provided
- Preview includes goal ID, objective, session ID, completion percentage, and progress
- Better guidance for creating sessions and querying goals properly

### Changed
- **goals-list** command now provides more helpful error messages and previews instead of failing silently
- Goal/subtask query workflow improved with contextual hints

### Fixed
- Goal completion command now uses correct repository methods
- Project embed command properly handles goal/subtask metadata

### Refactored
- Moved `forgejo-plugin-empirica/` (125MB) to separate `empirica-dashboards` repo
- Moved `slides/` (72MB) to separate `empirica-web` repo  
- Moved `archive/` folder to `empirica-web` repo
- Reduced main package size by ~200MB for cleaner distribution

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **`empirica project-init` command** - Interactive onboarding for new repositories
- **Per-project SEMANTIC_INDEX.yaml** - Each repo can have its own semantic documentation index
- **Project-level BEADS defaults** - Configure BEADS behavior per-project
- **CLI hints for BEADS** - Helpful tips after goal creation
- **Better error messages** - Install instructions when BEADS CLI not found
- **Configuration examples** - Added docs/examples/project.yaml.example

### Fixed
- **Database fragmentation (AI Amnesia)** - MCP server now uses repo-local database
- **refdoc-add UnboundLocalError** - Fixed variable usage before assignment
- **MCP server postflight regression** - Added missing resolve_session_id import
- **goals-ready schema bug** - Fixed vectors_json → individual columns
- **Project auto-detection** - Made --project-id optional with git remote URL auto-detection

### Changed
- **Project-session linking** - Added explicit --project-id flag to session-create
- **Project bootstrap** - Now auto-detects project from git remote
- **Documentation organization** - Moved session summaries to docs/development/

### Investigated
- **BEADS default behavior** - Kept opt-in (matches industry standards: Git LFS, npm, Python)
- Evidence: 5 major tools analyzed, high confidence decision (know=0.9, uncertainty=0.15)


## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-18

### Summary
First stable release of Empirica - genuine AI epistemic self-assessment framework.

### Added
- **MCO (Model-Centric Operations)**: Persona-aware configuration system
  - AI model profiles with bias corrections
  - Persona definitions (implementer, architect, researcher)
  - Cascade style configurations
- **CASCADE Workflow**: Complete epistemic assessment framework
  - PREFLIGHT: Initial epistemic state assessment
  - CHECK: Decision gate (proceed vs investigate)
  - POSTFLIGHT: Learning measurement and calibration
- **Unified Storage**: GitEnhancedReflexLogger for atomic writes
  - SQLite reflexes table integration
  - Git notes synchronization
  - JSON checkpoint export
- **Session Management**: Fast session create/resume
  - 97.5% token reduction via checkpoint loading
  - Uncertainty-driven bootstrap (scales with AI uncertainty)
- **Project Bootstrap**: Dynamic context loading
  - Recent findings, unknowns, mistakes
  - Dead ends (avoid repeated failures)
  - Qdrant semantic search integration
- **Multi-AI Coordination**: Epistemic handoffs between agents
- **CLI Commands**:
  - `empirica session-create` - Start new session
  - `empirica preflight-submit` - Submit initial assessment
  - `empirica check` - Decision gate
