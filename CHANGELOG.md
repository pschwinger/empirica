# Changelog

All notable changes to Empirica will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Schema/API Mismatch in Epistemic Artifacts** - BreadcrumbRepository methods (log_finding, log_unknown, log_dead_end) expected schema columns that were missing from database definitions:
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_findings table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_findings table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_unknowns table
  - Added `subject TEXT` to project_dead_ends table
  - Added `impact REAL DEFAULT 0.5` to project_dead_ends table
- Impact: Users following system prompt documentation would get immediate SQLite errors when trying to use epistemic artifact tracking
- Testing: Verified with fresh project initialization - all epistemic tracking APIs now work correctly
- This fix enables proper meta-tracking of complex multi-channel projects (e.g., outreach campaigns)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: CHECK GATE confidence threshold bug** - The CHECK command was ignoring explicit confidence values provided by AI agents and instead calculating confidence from uncertainty vectors (1.0 - uncertainty). This prevented the proper enforcement of the ≥0.70 confidence threshold for the CASCADE GATE. Fixed by:
  - Extracting `explicit_confidence` from CHECK input config
  - Using explicit confidence in decision logic when provided
  - Making proceed/investigate decision based on confidence ≥ 0.70 threshold as per system design
  - Keeping drift and unknowns as secondary evidence validation
- **Impact**: All users now have a properly functioning CHECK GATE that respects stated confidence while validating against evidence

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Version 1.1.0 Release** - Fixed version mismatch issue where build artifacts contained old version
- **Build process improvement** - Added step to clean build/ and dist/ directories before building
- **Version consistency** - Updated all documentation and configuration files to reflect 1.1.0

- **Documentation organization** - Moved development docs to archive, organized guides and reference docs
- **Version alignment** - Updated version across all documentation files

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **workspace-overview command** - Epistemic project management dashboard
  - Shows epistemic health of all projects in workspace
  - Health scoring algorithm: `(know * 0.6) + ((1 - uncertainty) * 0.4) - (dead_end_ratio * 0.2)`
  - Color-coded health tiers: 🟢 high (≥0.7), 🟡 medium (0.5-0.7), 🔴 low (<0.5)
  - Sorting options: activity, knowledge, uncertainty, name
  - Filtering by project status: active, inactive, complete
  - JSON and dashboard output formats

### Database
- `get_workspace_overview()` - Aggregates epistemic state across all projects

- Health metrics include: know, uncertainty, findings, unknowns, dead ends

### Dogfooding
- Successfully used Empirica's full CASCADE workflow to build these features

- **Documentation organization** - Moved session summaries to docs/development/

### Investigated
- **BEADS default behavior** - Kept opt-in (matches industry standards: Git LFS, npm, Python)
- Evidence: 5 major tools analyzed, high confidence decision (know=0.9, uncertainty=0.15)
