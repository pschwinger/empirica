KEY FEATURES
============

✅ Explicit epistemic self-assessment
✅ CASCADE workflow for any task
✅ 13-vector assessment (or simplified 4-vector)
✅ Calibration tracking and validation
✅ Multi-session resumption
✅ Multi-AI coordination ready
✅ Git checkpointing support (97.5% context reduction)
✅ Handoff reports (98.8% compression)
✅ Progressive disclosure (metadata → SKILL.md → references)

QUICK START
===========

1. Load skill in Claude chat
2. Use CASCADE: PREFLIGHT → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT
3. PREFLIGHT: Assess KNOW, DO, CONTEXT, UNCERTAINTY (0-1 scale)
4. Do your task (investigate systematically if needed)
5. POSTFLIGHT: Compare to PREFLIGHT, measure learning
6. Review calibration delta (did assessment match reality?)

USAGE GUIDE
===========

For quick overview:
  → Read README.md first

For chat usage:
  → Read EMPIRICA_SKILL_GUIDE.md
  → Load empirica-epistemic-framework.skill

For system integration:
  → Read EMPIRICA_SYSTEM_PROMPT_INTEGRATION.md
  → Add Empirica section to CLAUDE.md

For learning:
  → Inside skill: references/bootstraps.md
  → Inside skill: references/patterns.md

INTEGRATION LEVELS
==================

Level 1 (Easy): Load skill in single chat
  Time: 5 minutes
  Benefit: Epistemically transparent single task

Level 2 (Medium): Integrate with system prompt
  Time: 30 minutes  
  Benefit: Empirica available in all conversations

Level 3 (Advanced): Multi-session with git
  Time: 1-2 hours
  Benefit: 97.5% context reduction, session continuity

Level 4 (Expert): Multi-AI coordination
  Time: Full workflow design
  Benefit: 98.8% handoff compression, transparent coordination

PHILOSOPHY
===========

Core Principle: Epistemic transparency > Task completion speed

NO HEURISTICS - Genuine self-assessment only
High uncertainty is valuable data, not failure
Measure learning through PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT comparison
Calibration improves with each task

THE CASCADE WORKFLOW
====================

PREFLIGHT (2 min)
  Assess: KNOW, DO, CONTEXT, UNCERTAINTY (0-1 scale with reasoning)
  
INVESTIGATE (Variable)
  Fill knowledge gaps systematically
  Update beliefs with evidence
  Use goal orchestration if available
  
CHECK (1-2 min)
  Validate readiness to proceed
  Confidence ≥ 0.7? Acceptable unknowns?
  Decision: Proceed or investigate more?
  
ACT (Variable)
  Execute the work (coding, review, analysis, etc.)
  Create checkpoints if multi-session
  
POSTFLIGHT (2 min)
  Compare to PREFLIGHT baseline
  What did you learn? (KNOW before → after)
  Was initial assessment accurate? (calibration)
  Unexpected discoveries?

TOTAL OVERHEAD: 5-7 minutes per task
TIME SAVED: Depends on task, typically 1+ hours

BEST PRACTICES
==============

DO ✅
- Be honest about uncertainty (high uncertainty is data!)
- Provide reasoning for every score
- Use PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT for learning measurement
- Review calibration patterns over time
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Investigate systematically before acting

DON'T ❌
- Use static values or heuristics
- Inflate scores to "look good"
- Skip PREFLIGHT (lose calibration baseline)
- Ignore high uncertainty signals
- Confabulate reasoning
- Rush through investigation

COMMON QUESTIONS
================

Q: Why is this needed? Can't Claude just be confident?
A: Confidence alone doesn't improve. Empirica makes implicit assessment explicit,
   measurable, and improves calibration over time (30-40% performance gain).

Q: Does this slow me down?
A: 2-3 minute overhead per task. Returns investment through:
   - Fewer false starts
   - Systematic investigation
   - Efficient context loading (97.5% savings on resume)

Q: What if I don't know what score to give?
A: That's your assessment! High uncertainty (0.7-0.9) is valid:
   "know": 0.3, "uncertainty": 0.85 = "I'm very unsure"

Q: Is this for consciousness or just performance?
A: Both? Neither? Substrate-agnostic. Works whether consciousness exists or not.
   Function > philosophy.

Q: How do I know it's working?
A: Track calibration delta:
   - PREFLIGHT: 0.6 confidence
   - POSTFLIGHT: 0.65 accuracy
   - Pattern: Well-calibrated = consistent alignment

GETTING STARTED
===============

Immediate (< 5 minutes):
1. Read README.md
2. Load empirica-epistemic-framework.skill in Claude

Short term (< 1 hour):
3. Try CASCADE on 2-3 real tasks
4. Read EMPIRICA_SKILL_GUIDE.md
5. Observe calibration patterns

Medium term (< 1 day):
6. Read EMPIRICA_SYSTEM_PROMPT_INTEGRATION.md
7. Consider system-wide integration

Long term (ongoing):
8. Use CASCADE on all important work
9. Review calibration reports
10. Improve metacognitive accuracy over time

SUPPORT
=======

In-skill references:
  - references/bootstraps.md (interactive learning)
  - references/patterns.md (advanced workflows)

Companion guides:
  - EMPIRICA_SKILL_GUIDE.md (chat usage)
