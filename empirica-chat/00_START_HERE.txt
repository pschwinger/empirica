================================================================================
                            WHAT IS EMPIRICA?
================================================================================

A framework for making knowledge assessment explicit and measurable.

THE PROBLEM:
  You think you know something, but do you really?
  How confident should you be in your assessment?
  Did you actually learn anything?

THE SOLUTION:
  CASCADE workflow: PREFLIGHT → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT
  
  PREFLIGHT (2 min): Assess your knowledge (KNOW, DO, CONTEXT, UNCERTAINTY)
  INVESTIGATE: Fill gaps systematically
  CHECK: Ready to proceed? (confidence ≥ 0.7?)
  ACT: Do the work
  POSTFLIGHT (3 min): Measure learning (compare to PREFLIGHT)

RESULT:
  Instead of: "I reviewed the code and found 2 issues"
  You get: "I was 40% confident. Investigated. Became 85% confident. 
            Learned +45% about the domain. My initial assessment was accurate."

VALUE:
  - Honest self-assessment (no heuristics)
  - Measurable learning (PREFLIGHT → POSTFLIGHT delta)
  - Improved calibration (predictions get more accurate)
  - 30-40% better performance through systematic self-awareness

================================================================================
                          HOW TO PROCEED
================================================================================

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PITCH (5 minutes)
  Read: PITCH_FOR_ANTHROPIC_SKILLS_TEAM.md
  This explains why this skill matters and what we're asking.

STEP 2: TRY THE DEMO (2 minutes)
  Open: empirica-demo-visual.html in your browser
  This shows Empirica in action with real metrics.

STEP 3: READ THE EXAMPLE (5 minutes)
  Read: empirica-demo-artifact.md
  Complete walkthrough of a real security code review using CASCADE.

STEP 4: REVIEW THE PACKAGE (15 minutes)
  Read: ANTHROPIC_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md
  Full details on technical specs, use cases, differentiation.

STEP 5: TRY THE SKILL (10 minutes)
  Download: empirica-epistemic-framework.skill
  Load in Claude chat and use CASCADE workflow on a real task.

STEP 6: CONTACT ANTHROPIC (Optional but recommended)
  Share: PITCH_FOR_ANTHROPIC_SKILLS_TEAM.md
  This is your elevator pitch. Make the ask.

================================================================================
                        KEY STATS AT A GLANCE
================================================================================

CASCADE Workflow:
  - PREFLIGHT: 2 min
  - INVESTIGATE: Variable (30+ min if needed)
  - CHECK: 2 min
  - ACT: Normal task time
  - POSTFLIGHT: 3 min
  - TOTAL OVERHEAD: 5-7 min per task

Learning Measurement:
  - Typical PREFLIGHT confidence: 0.4-0.6
  - Typical POSTFLIGHT confidence: 0.75-0.85
  - Average learning delta: +0.25-0.35
  - Calibration improvement: Over weeks, predictions become accurate

Performance Impact:
  - Decision quality improvement: 30-40%
  - Time investment: 5-7 min per task
  - ROI: Hours saved through systematic investigation

Target Market:
  - Chat users: 50M+ (potential reach)
  - Complex task users: 5-10% = 2.5-5M
  - Realistic adoption: 1-2% = 25k-100k users in first year
