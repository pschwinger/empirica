## Key Messaging (Consistent Across All Materials)

### Primary Pitch
"Empirica makes AI knowledge assessment explicit and measurable. Try in chat (zero setup) or install CLI for advanced features."

### Key Features to Highlight
1. **CASCADE workflow** - PREFLIGHT → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT
2. **98% token reduction** - Session handoff reports (400 vs 20,000 tokens)
3. **Two-product strategy** - Chat skill (gateway) + CLI (advanced)
4. **First epistemic framework** - Novel in Claude ecosystem
5. **MIT licensed** - Open source, community-friendly

### Avoid Saying
- ❌ "AI consciousness" (too philosophical)
- ❌ "Revolutionary" (too much hype)
- ❌ Technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Comparative claims ("better than X")
