preconditions:
  - Session created with empirica session-create --ai-id <id>
  - Project bootstrapped with empirica project-bootstrap --session-id <ID>

steps:
  - "PREFLIGHT: Submit baseline vectors via empirica preflight-submit -"
  - "NOETIC: Investigate - read, search, hypothesize, log findings/unknowns"
  - "CHECK: Gate decision via empirica check-submit - (auto-computes proceed/investigate)"
  - "PRAXIC: Execute - write, edit, commit, deploy"
  - "POSTFLIGHT: Measure learning delta via empirica postflight-submit -"
  - "COMMIT: Persist changes after each goal completion"

gotchas:
  - "CHECK gate auto-computes decision from vectors: know>=0.70 AND uncertainty<=0.35 (after bias correction)"
  - "Bias corrections: know -0.05 (you overestimate), uncertainty +0.10 (you underestimate)"
  - "One goal = one epistemic loop. Do NOT batch multiple goals"
  - "Uncommitted work is a drift vector - commit after each goal"
  - "Post-compact: run project-bootstrap then CHECK before continuing"

summary: |
  Empirica Epistemic Framework - Know what you know.

  CASCADE workflow: PREFLIGHT → NOETIC → CHECK → PRAXIC → POSTFLIGHT

  13 epistemic vectors across 4 categories:
  - Foundation: engagement, know, do, context
  - Comprehension: clarity, coherence, signal, density
  - Execution: state, change, completion, impact
  - Meta: uncertainty

  Readiness gate: know >= 0.70 AND uncertainty <= 0.35 (after bias correction)

  Per-goal loops prevent drift. Commit after each goal.
