# Empirica Website V2 - Phased Development Plan
## Using Empirica Cascade Methodology with Necessity Vector

---

## 📊 Pre-Flight Epistemic Assessment

**Task:** Create Empirica website based on existing wireframes and design
**Complexity:** HIGH (multiple pages, consistent styling, content organization)
**Necessity Vector Assessment:**
- Information completeness: 0.8 (wireframes exist, design reference available)
- Requirement clarity: 0.7 (need to extract from existing site)
- Component dependencies: 0.6 (header/footer/nav reuse critical)
- Risk of omission: 0.7 (easy to miss pages or features)

**Cascade Decision:** PROCEED WITH PHASED INVESTIGATION → WIREFRAME VALIDATION → ITERATIVE BUILD

---

## Phase 1: INVESTIGATION & WIREFRAME VALIDATION (Current)

### Epistemic Goals
- Understand existing site structure completely
- Validate wireframes against current implementation
- Identify all required pages and components
- Extract design patterns and styling requirements

### Tasks
- [x] Review existing index.html for design reference
- [x] Check wireframes directory  
- [ ] Extract header/footer/nav component specifications
- [ ] List all required pages
- [ ] Document styling patterns (colors, fonts, spacing)
- [ ] Identify shared components vs page-specific content

### Deliverable
Validated wireframe with complete component breakdown

---

## Phase 2: COMPONENT EXTRACTION (Next)

### Epistemic Goals
- Create reusable header, footer, navigation components
- Establish consistent styling framework
- Ensure design fidelity to original

### Tasks
- Extract header component (logo, branding, CTAs)
- Extract navigation component (responsive, active states)
- Extract footer component (links, branding)
- Create breadcrumbs component
- Document CSS framework (Tailwind usage, custom styles)

### Deliverable
Standalone component HTML files ready for reuse

---

## Phase 3: HOME PAGE CONSTRUCTION

### Epistemic Goals
- Build complete home page using docs understanding
- Validate against wireframe
- Ensure responsive design

### Tasks
- Assemble components into home page structure
- Implement hero section (MCP server - Github Download)
- Build "What/How/Why/Who" section
- Add semantic engineering section
- Add Calibrated Confidence section
- Add Empirica Cli section
- Add components overview section
- Add get started section

### Deliverable
Complete, validated home page

---

## Phase 4: ADDITIONAL PAGES (Iterative)

### Pages to Build (in order of necessity)
1. Empirica Cli page
2. Calibrated Confidence page
   - Cascades
   - 13 Vectors
3. Components page
4. Cascades and Vectors page
5. Knowledge Base page
6. Contact page
7. AI Development Guide page

### Per-Page Process
- Review wireframe
- Pre-flight epistemic check (what's unclear?)
- Build page structure
- Add content
- Post-flight validation
- Iterative refinement

---

## Phase 5: INTEGRATION & VALIDATION

### Tasks
- Ensure all inter-page links work
- Validate responsive design across pages
- Check consistency of components
- Test navigation flow
- Validate against documentation
- Final epistemic assessment

---

## Necessity Vector Tracking

Throughout development, track:
- **Completeness:** What pages/features are still missing?
- **Coherence:** Do all pages feel like one cohesive site?
- **Parsimony:** Are we over-engineering or duplicating?
- **Explicit Uncertainty:** What design decisions need human input?

Each phase ends with epistemic assessment before proceeding.

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Investigation
Next immediate action: Complete component extraction from existing site
