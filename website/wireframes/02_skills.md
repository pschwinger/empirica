## Main Content

### Hero Section
**Title:** Empirica Skills: Metacognitive Capabilities for AI  
**Subtitle:** Structured knowledge that AIs read to develop epistemic humility and thoughtful self-reflection

---

### What Are Skills Section
**Title:** Understanding Empirica Skills

**Content:**
Skills are semantic documentation that AI systems read to understand how to:
- Assess their own uncertainty across 13 epistemic dimensions
- Make strategic investigation decisions
- Track their cognitive processes
- Collaborate with humans and other AI systems

Unlike traditional documentation, skills are written specifically for AI comprehension with clear semantic structure.

### How Skills Work Section
**Title:** Skills in Practice

**Process Flow Visualization:**
1. **AI Reads Skills** → Understands metacognitive framework
2. **Bootstrap Initializes** → Activates epistemic tracking
3. **Cascade Executes** → Applies learned patterns
4. **Auto-tracking Monitors** → Records all cognitive activity
5. **Continuous Learning** → Improves with each session

### Using Skills Section
**Title:** Integrating Skills into Your AI

**Two Approaches:**

**Approach 1: Via Bootstrap**
```python
from empirica.bootstraps import OptimalMetacognitiveBootstrap

# Bootstrap reads skills automatically
bootstrap = OptimalMetacognitiveBootstrap()
bootstrap.initialize()
```

**Approach 2: Via MCP Server**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "empirica": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["empirica_mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
Skills are automatically available to Claude Desktop.

### Skills Development Section
**Title:** Creating Custom Skills

**Content:**
You can extend Empirica with domain-specific skills following these principles:

1. **Semantic Clarity** - Clear naming and structure
2. **AI Comprehension** - Written for machine reading
3. **Epistemic Focus** - Emphasizes uncertainty awareness
4. **Practical Guidance** - Actionable, not theoretical
