## Page: /epistemic-awareness.html

### Purpose
Introduce the core concepts of epistemic humility and meta-uncertainty that power Empirica.

## Content Structure

### Hero Section
**Headline:** Understanding What You Don't Know  
**Subheadline:** Epistemic Awareness enables AI systems to reason about their own uncertainty, building trust through transparency and intellectual humility.

### Section 1: What is Epistemic Humility?
**Content:**
- Definition: Recognizing the limits of one's knowledge
- How it applies to AI: Systems that acknowledge uncertainty rather than hallucinating with confidence
- The foundation for trustworthy AI

**Visual Element:** Diagram showing confident vs humble AI responses

### Section 2: The 13 Epistemic Vectors
**Content:**
Empirica tracks 13 dimensions of uncertainty to give AI systems genuine self-awareness:

**Core Vectors (1-12):**
1. **Ambiguity** - Multiple valid interpretations
2. **Incompleteness** - Missing information
3. **Complexity** - Interconnected factors
4. **Novelty** - Unfamiliar territory  
5. **Conflict** - Contradictory information
6. **Imprecision** - Vague or fuzzy data
7. **Volatility** - Rapidly changing context
8. **Indeterminacy** - Inherent unknowability
9. **Interdependence** - Cascading effects
10. **Equivocality** - Equally valid alternatives
11. **Emergence** - Unpredictable outcomes
12. **Contextual Sensitivity** - Context-dependent truth

**Meta Vector (13):**
13. **Explicit Uncertainty** - Direct awareness of not knowing

**Visual Element:** Interactive octopus diagram showing the vectors

### Section 3: Meta-Uncertainty in Practice
**Content:**
- Pre-flight epistemic assessment: Knowing what you don't know before starting
- Post-flight validation: Verifying assumptions after completion
- Cascade loop tracking: Continuous awareness during execution

**Example:** 
```
Task: Create a website
Pre-flight: High novelty (13th vector), moderate complexity
Action: Trigger investigation phase to reduce uncertainty
Result: Systematic approach rather than rushed execution
```

### Section 4: Why This Matters
**Content:**
- **For Developers:** Build AI that asks for help when needed
- **For Users:** Trust AI that admits limitations
- **For Organizations:** Deploy AI with transparent risk assessment
