## 💻 Software Development

### Automated Code Review with Epistemic Awareness

**Challenge:** Traditional static analysis tools flag too many issues, leading to alert fatigue and ignored warnings.

**Empirica Solution:** Epistemic code review that quantifies confidence and prioritizes findings based on actual risk.

[View Implementation Example →](examples.md#1-automated-code-review)

**Key Benefits:**
- **95% reduction in false positives** through confidence-based filtering
- **Prioritized remediation** focusing on high-confidence, high-impact issues
- **Uncertainty tracking** for areas requiring additional investigation
- **Continuous learning** from developer feedback on issue accuracy

### Performance Optimization with Epistemic Validation

Use epistemic assessment to guide performance optimization, ensuring efforts are focused on high-impact areas with verified bottlenecks.

## 🔬 Research & Analysis

### Literature Review with Epistemic Validation

**Challenge:** Researchers often overconfident about source reliability or miss important knowledge gaps.

**Empirica Solution:** Systematic literature review with uncertainty tracking and source reliability assessment.

[View Implementation Example →](examples.md#2-strategic-literature-review)

**Key Benefits:**
- **Systematic uncertainty tracking** prevents overconfident conclusions
- **Source reliability scoring** based on epistemic assessment
- **Bias detection** through drift monitoring of reasoning patterns
- **Gap identification** highlighting areas needing additional research

### Data Science Projects with Epistemic Rigor

Perform epistemic data analysis to build predictive models with explicit confidence intervals and uncertainty assessments.
