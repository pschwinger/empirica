# Git Integration: Cognitive Infrastructure

**Making Git Sexy Again.**

We repurpose Git from code versioning to **epistemic infrastructure**.

---

## Why Git?

<!-- BENTO_START -->

## 🌍 Distributed Design
**No central authority.**

- Works offline.
- Container-native coordination.
- Resilient architecture.

## 📝 Audit Trail
**Complete history.**

- Cryptographically signed commits.
- Immutable reasoning logs.
- Compliance ready.

## 🤖 Automated Governance
**Sentinel orchestration.**

- Hooks for safety checks.
- Automated branching/merging.
- Zero-trust verification.

## Workflow Examples

### Single AI Session
1. **PREFLIGHT:** Commit initial state.
2. **INVESTIGATE:** Branch for reasoning.
3. **CHECK:** Merge validation.
4. **ACT:** Commit code changes.
5. **POSTFLIGHT:** Measure learning delta.

### Multi-AI Coordination
- **AI-1:** Pushes complete epistemic state.
- **AI-2:** Fetches and rebases.
- **Result:** Seamless handoff without manual summaries.

### Calibration
**Sentinel** measures efficiency of reasoning branches and merges the best path.

## Key Takeaway

**Git is cognitive infrastructure.**
It tracks distributed work with complete, signed, immutable history.

- **Commits** = CASCADE snapshots.
- **Notes** = Structured epistemic data.
- **Branches** = Reasoning paths.
