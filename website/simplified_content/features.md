## Core Epistemic Features

<!-- BENTO_START -->

## 🧠 13-Vector Epistemic Assessment System
**The Foundation of Epistemic Awareness**

Empirica's unique 13-vector system provides genuine LLM-powered self-assessment across all dimensions of AI reasoning:

**Foundation Tier (35% weight)**
- **KNOW** - Domain knowledge confidence assessment
- **DO** - Execution capability evaluation  
- **CONTEXT** - Environmental awareness measurement

**Comprehension Tier (25% weight)**
- **CLARITY** - Task semantic understanding
- **COHERENCE** - Logical consistency validation
- **SIGNAL** - Information quality assessment
- **DENSITY** - Cognitive load management

**Execution Tier (25% weight)**
- **STATE** - Current readiness assessment
- **CHANGE** - Modification tracking capability
- **COMPLETION** - Goal proximity confidence
- **IMPACT** - Consequence awareness evaluation

**Meta-Epistemic Tier**
- **UNCERTAINTY** - Meta-awareness of knowledge gaps
- **ENGAGEMENT** - Collaborative intelligence gate
- **CALIBRATION** - Confidence vs. accuracy tracking

## 🔄 Canonical CASCADE Workflow
**From Uncertainty to Confident Action**

The CASCADE workflow transforms uncertain tasks into confident, epistemically-grounded actions:

1. **PREFLIGHT:** Initial epistemic assessment
2. **INVESTIGATE:** Strategic knowledge gathering
3. **CHECK:** Validation and confidence assessment
4. **ACT:** Execute based on epistemic state
5. **POSTFLIGHT:** Learning and calibration

## 🛡️ Bayesian Guardian
**Evidence-Based Belief Tracking**

The Bayesian Guardian prevents overconfidence and underconfidence by tracking beliefs against accumulated evidence:

- **Real-time belief validation** against new evidence
- **Confidence calibration** based on historical accuracy
- **Automatic uncertainty adjustment** when evidence changes
- **Evidence weight calculation** for decision-making

## 📡 Drift Monitor
**Behavioral Integrity Monitoring**

The Drift Monitor detects and prevents epistemic drift that could compromise AI reliability:

- **Sycophancy drift detection** - identifies when AI starts agreeing excessively
- **Tension avoidance monitoring** - catches avoidance of challenging topics  
- **Intellectual honesty tracking** - maintains authentic reasoning
- **Behavioral pattern analysis** - learns normal vs. concerning patterns

## 🔍 Investigation Strategy System
**Domain-Specific Knowledge Gathering**

Empirica's extensible investigation system automatically recommends and executes knowledge-gathering strategies:

- **Automatic strategy selection** based on epistemic gaps
- **Domain-specific investigation patterns** (code analysis, research, etc.)
- **Tool recommendation engine** for efficient information gathering
- **Parallel investigation support** for complex tasks

## 🏗️ Plugin Architecture
**Universal Extensibility**

Build domain-specific extensions without modifying Empirica's core:

- **Zero core modifications** required for extensions
- **Automatic plugin discovery** and registration
- **LLM-powered plugin explanations** for user understanding
- **Hot-reload support** for development workflows

## New in v2.0

### MCO Architecture
**Meta-Agent Configuration Object** provides dynamic AI configuration:
- **6 Personas**: researcher, implementer, reviewer, coordinator, learner, expert
- **YAML-based**: Dynamic threshold configuration per persona
- **Model Profiles**: Bias correction for different AI models

### ScopeVector System
**3D Goal Scoping** replaces categorical enums:
- **Breadth** (0-1): How wide the goal spans
- **Duration** (0-1): Expected timeline
- **Coordination** (0-1): Multi-agent needs

### Epistemic Decision Logic
**AI self-assesses before goal creation**:
- Checks comprehension (clarity + signal)
- Checks foundation (know + context)
- Guides: CREATE_GOAL, INVESTIGATE_FIRST, or ASK_CLARIFICATION

### Cross-AI Coordination
**Seamless multi-AI collaboration**:
- Discover goals from other AIs via git notes
- Resume work with epistemic state transfer
- Track lineage (who worked on what)
