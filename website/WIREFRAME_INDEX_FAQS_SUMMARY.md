---

## What Was Created

### 1. Updated Navigation (wireframe_home.html)
- Added **FAQs** menu item between "Docs" and "Contact Us"
- Now 6 menu items evenly spaced: Epistemic Awareness, Components, API, Docs, FAQs, Contact Us
- Updated both desktop and mobile navigation

### 2. Index Page Wireframe (07_index.md)
**Purpose**: Homepage using What/Why/How/Who methodology

**Sections**:
1. **Hero Section** - Logo, headline, sub-headline, dual CTAs
2. **Foundation (What/Why/How/Who)** - 4-box grid explaining:
   - WHAT is Empirica (epistemic reasoning system)
   - WHY epistemic humility (prevents errors, builds trust)
   - HOW it works (cascade flow)
   - WHO it's for (developers, researchers, organizations)
3. **Core Concepts** - 3 feature cards:
   - Semantic Engineering
   - Tmux Dashboard visualization
   - Integration & Examples
4. **13 Epistemic Vectors** - Expandable groups showing all 5 categories
5. **Advanced Capabilities** - 2-column feature list (Bayesian Guardian, Drift Monitor, etc.)
6. **Quick Start** - Code example with installation steps
7. **Components Overview** - Brief mention of 24+ components in 6 categories
8. **Final CTA** - Get Started / Documentation / Community

**Design Notes**:
- Non-marketing, factual tone
- Small business focus (no enterprise/teams)
- Minimal link duplication
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 3. FAQs Page Wireframe (08_faqs.md)
**Purpose**: Searchable, categorized FAQ based on production documentation

**Features**:
- **Search Bar** - Live filtering across 30 questions
- **Category Tabs** - 7 categories with counts
- **Accordion UI** - Expandable Q&A pairs
- **Deep Linking** - Direct links to specific questions

**Categories & Question Count**:
1. **Getting Started** (5 questions) - Installation, basic usage, Claude integration
2. **Epistemic Vectors** (4 questions) - 13 vectors, UNCERTAINTY, ENGAGEMENT, weights
3. **Components & Features** (5 questions) - Bayesian Guardian, Drift Monitor, plugins, tracking, catalog
4. **Configuration & Setup** (4 questions) - Enabling features, thresholds, data storage, multi-AI
5. **Integration & MCP** (3 questions) - MCP, model compatibility, integration patterns
6. **Troubleshooting** (4 questions) - Common issues and solutions
7. **Advanced Topics** (5 questions) - Approach B, necessity logic, custom vectors, pre/post flight, semantic engineering

**Content Quality**:
- All answers based on actual production documentation
- Code examples where helpful
- Cross-links to relevant docs
- Keywords for search optimization
- Consistent formatting

## Epistemic Assessment

### Pre-Investigation
- **Overall Confidence**: 0.75
- **UNCERTAINTY**: 0.45
- **Key Gaps**: Content structure, FAQ categories, depth of detail

### Investigation Actions
1. Read existing wireframes (structure and patterns)
2. Read production docs (00_COMPLETE_SUMMARY, 22_FAQ, DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE_V2)
3. Read epistemic vector docs (05_EPISTEMIC_VECTORS)
4. Located assets and existing components

### Post-Investigation
- **Overall Confidence**: 0.87
- **UNCERTAINTY**: 0.20
- **Δuncertainty**: -0.25 ✅ (investigation effective)
- **Key Improvements**: Clear content structure, comprehensive FAQ coverage, accurate technical details

---

## Cascade Phase Completion

✅ **ENGAGEMENT** (0.85) - Task clear and well-specified
✅ **UNCERTAINTY** (0.45 → 0.20) - Reduced through investigation
✅ **INVESTIGATE** - Documentation review completed
✅ **CHECK** - Content validated against docs
✅ **ACT** - Wireframes created successfully

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review wireframes for accuracy and completeness
2. Make any necessary refinements based on feedback
3. Prepare for implementation phase

### Implementation Phase (Future)
1. Convert wireframes to HTML pages
2. Implement search functionality for FAQs
3. Add interactive elements (accordions, filters)
4. Copy assets from empirica_web1
5. Test responsive layouts
6. Validate all links and cross-references

### Content Additions Needed (Future)
- Semantic Engineering deep dive page/section
- Integration & Examples page
- Detailed component documentation pages
- Individual doc pages matching /docs.html structure

## Notes

- **Necessity Vector**: This task demonstrated the importance of necessity assessment. Initial investigation revealed gaps in understanding optimal content structure and FAQ categories. Investigation filled those gaps, reducing uncertainty from 0.45 to 0.20 and increasing overall confidence from 0.75 to 0.87.

- **Cascade Effectiveness**: The cascade worked as designed - ENGAGEMENT passed, UNCERTAINTY was measured, investigation was strategic, checks validated accuracy, and action was executed confidently.

- **Documentation Quality**: The comprehensive production documentation made creating accurate wireframes straightforward. All technical details (13 vectors, cascade phases, component counts) are factually correct.

- **Phased Approach**: These wireframes enable the next phase of development without requiring full implementation immediately. They serve as both design spec and content guide.
