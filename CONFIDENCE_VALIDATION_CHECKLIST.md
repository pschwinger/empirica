## How to Use This Checklist

### For Each Phase:

1. **Complete the phase work** (refer to PROJECT_SPEC_DISTRIBUTION.md and HANDOFF_DISTRIBUTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

2. **Work through the checklist section** for that phase
   - Check off each item as you verify it
   - Mark items as N/A only with explicit justification
   - Don't skip items without good reason

3. **Count checkboxes:**
   - Total checkboxes in section
   - Checkboxes you checked (✓)
   - Calculate: (checked / total) × 100 = %

4. **Compare to threshold:**
   - If ≥95%: You have 95% confidence, proceed to next phase
   - If <95%: You have uncertainty, go back and fix/verify

5. **Document results:**
   - Note any items that were difficult
   - Note any items that revealed bugs
   - Note anything that surprised you

### Red Flags (Investigate Immediately):

- Fewer than 80% checkboxes passed → Major issues, don't proceed
- Items with caveats/exceptions → Investigate before trusting
- Skipped items → Validate why before proceeding
- Tests that "mostly worked" → Define "mostly" more rigorously

---

## What 95% Confidence Means

It means:
- ✅ You've verified the core functionality
- ✅ You've tested on representative platforms/providers
- ✅ You've found and fixed bugs during testing
- ✅ You understand what could still go wrong and why
- ✅ You would use this yourself

It does NOT mean:
- ❌ Everything is perfect (no software is)
- ❌ No edge cases exist (they always do)
- ❌ You've tested every possible scenario
- ❌ No future bugs will be found

It DOES mean:
- ✅ The core work is solid
- ✅ The foundation is stable
- ✅ You can defend your decisions
- ✅ You're ready to show others

---

**Use this checklist for each phase. Don't skip. Trust the process.**
