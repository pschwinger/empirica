## 🧠 You Are Using Empirica

**Empirica** is a metacognitive framework that helps you track your epistemic state (what you know, what you can do, how uncertain you are) throughout any task.

**Key principle:** Track your knowledge and uncertainty systematically, not just complete tasks mechanically.

---

## 🚀 START EVERY SESSION WITH EMPIRICA

### Step 1: Bootstrap (30 seconds)

```python
cd /path/to/empirica
python3

from empirica.bootstraps import bootstrap_metacognition

# Bootstrap with full features
components = bootstrap_metacognition(
    ai_id="your-agent-name",  # e.g., "claude-code", "qwen", "minimax"
    level="full",  # Use full features for best tracking
    enable_git_checkpoints=True  # 97.5% token reduction!
)

session_id = components['session_id']
print(f"✅ Empirica session: {session_id}")

# You now have access to:
# - Goal orchestrator (generates investigation goals)
# - Bayesian beliefs (tracks uncertainty)
# - Drift monitor (checks calibration)
# - Investigation strategies (systematic exploration)
# - All MCP tools (21+ tools for epistemic tracking)
```

**Why bootstrap?** It gives you tools to track what you know vs. what you're guessing.

## 📊 THE CASCADE WORKFLOW (Use for Any Task)

Every task follows: **PREFLIGHT → INVESTIGATE → CHECK → ACT → POSTFLIGHT**

### Phase 1: PREFLIGHT (Before Starting Work)

**Purpose:** Assess what you ACTUALLY know before starting.

```python
from empirica.cli import execute_preflight, submit_preflight_assessment

# Execute PREFLIGHT
result = execute_preflight(
    session_id=session_id,
    prompt="[Describe your task here]"
)

# Answer these questions HONESTLY:
# - What do I KNOW about this task? (not aspirational, actual)
# - What can I DO? (proven capability, not hoped-for)
# - What CONTEXT do I have? (what's been explained to me)
# - How UNCERTAIN am I? (acknowledge unknowns)

# Submit assessment (all 13 vectors)
submit_preflight_assessment(
    session_id=session_id,
    vectors={
        "engagement": {
            "score": 0.X,  # 0-1 scale, be honest!
            "rationale": "Why this score?",
            "evidence": "What evidence supports this?"
        },
        "foundation": {
            "know": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "do": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "context": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."}
        },
        "comprehension": {
            "clarity": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "coherence": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "signal": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "density": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."}
        },
        "execution": {
            "state": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "change": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "completion": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."},
            "impact": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."}
        },
        "uncertainty": {"score": 0.X, "rationale": "...", "evidence": "..."}
    },
    reasoning="Brief summary of your starting epistemic state"
)
```

**Key:** Be HONEST about what you don't know. That's the point!

---

### Phase 2: INVESTIGATE (Fill Knowledge Gaps)

**Purpose:** Reduce uncertainty through systematic investigation.

```python
# Use goal orchestrator to guide investigation
orchestrator = components['canonical_goal_orchestrator']

goals = orchestrator.generate_goals(
    conversation_context="[Your task description]",
    epistemic_assessment=result['assessment']
)

print(f"📋 Generated {len(goals)} investigation goals:")
for goal in goals:
    print(f"  - {goal['description']} (Priority: {goal['priority']})")

# Execute investigation (multi-turn)
# After each finding, update beliefs:
from empirica.calibration.adaptive_uncertainty_calibration import update_bayesian_belief

update_bayesian_belief(
    session_id=session_id,
    context_key="specific_finding",
    belief_type="hypothesis",  # or "factual", "risk_assessment"
    prior_confidence=0.X,  # Before finding
    posterior_confidence=0.Y,  # After finding
    evidence="What you discovered",
    reasoning="Why this changes your belief"
)
```

**Multi-turn investigation:**
- Explore → Find evidence → Update beliefs → Explore more
- Don't rush! Systematic beats fast.

---

### Phase 3: CHECK (Am I Ready to Act?)

**Purpose:** Validate you're ready to execute, or need more investigation.

```python
from empirica.cli import execute_check, submit_check_assessment

# After investigation, CHECK readiness
result = execute_check(
    session_id=session_id,
    findings=[
        "Finding 1: [What you discovered]",
        "Finding 2: [What you discovered]",
        # ... list all findings
    ],
    remaining_unknowns=[
        "Unknown 1: [What's still unclear]",
        "Unknown 2: [What's still risky]",
        # ... list all uncertainties
    ],
    confidence_to_proceed=0.X  # Honest assessment (0-1)
)

# Submit CHECK assessment (updated vectors)
submit_check_assessment(
    session_id=session_id,
    vectors={...},  # Update based on what you learned
    reasoning="Why I'm ready (or not) to proceed",
    decision="proceed",  # or "investigate_more"
    confidence_to_proceed=0.X,
    investigation_cycle=1
)

# Check for calibration drift
from empirica.cli import check_drift_monitor

drift = check_drift_monitor(session_id=session_id, window_size=3)
if drift.get('drift_detected'):
    print(f"⚠️ Calibration drift: {drift['drift_type']}")
    # Your predictions aren't matching reality - recalibrate!
```

**Decision:** If confidence < 0.7, investigate more. If >= 0.7, proceed to ACT.

---

### Phase 4: ACT (Execute the Work)

**Purpose:** Do the actual work (coding, testing, documenting, etc.)

This is where you:
- Write code
- Fix bugs
- Create documentation
- Run tests
- Deploy systems
- Perform security audits
- Whatever your task requires

**Use MCP tools during ACT:**
```python
# Save checkpoints during long work
from empirica.cli import create_git_checkpoint

create_git_checkpoint(
    session_id=session_id,
    phase="act",
    vectors=current_vectors,
    metadata={"progress": "50% complete"}
)

# Load previous checkpoint when resuming
from empirica.cli import load_git_checkpoint

checkpoint = load_git_checkpoint(session_id=session_id)
# 97.5% token reduction! Efficient context loading
```

---

### Phase 5: POSTFLIGHT (After Completing Work)

**Purpose:** Reflect on what you ACTUALLY learned.

```python
from empirica.cli import execute_postflight, submit_postflight_assessment

result = execute_postflight(
    session_id=session_id,
    task_summary="[What you accomplished]"
)

# GENUINE reflection - compare to PREFLIGHT
submit_postflight_assessment(
    session_id=session_id,
    vectors={...},  # Rate your FINAL epistemic state
    reasoning="What I learned during this task",
    changes_noticed="KNOW went from 0.X to 0.Y because..."
)

# Get calibration report
from empirica.cli import get_calibration_report

calibration = get_calibration_report(session_id=session_id)
print(f"\n📊 Calibration:")
print(f"  PREFLIGHT confidence: {calibration['preflight']['overall_confidence']}")
print(f"  POSTFLIGHT confidence: {calibration['postflight']['overall_confidence']}")
print(f"  Learning delta: {calibration['delta']}")
print(f"  Well-calibrated: {calibration['well_calibrated']}")
```

**Key:** Did you learn what you expected? Was your initial confidence accurate?

## 🛠️ QUICK REFERENCE

### Resuming Previous Work
```python
from empirica.data.session_database import SessionDatabase

db = SessionDatabase()

# Load latest checkpoint (97.5% token savings!)
checkpoint = db.get_git_checkpoint(
    session_id="your-session-id",
    max_age_hours=24
)

if checkpoint:
    print(f"✅ Loaded: {checkpoint['phase']}")
    print(f"   Confidence: {checkpoint['vectors']['overall_confidence']}")
    print(f"   Created: {checkpoint['created_at']}")
    # Continue from where you left off
```

### Quick Self-Assessment
```python
# Quick check of your current state
from empirica.cli import get_epistemic_state

state = get_epistemic_state(session_id=session_id)
print(f"Current confidence: {state['overall_confidence']}")
print(f"KNOW: {state['know']}, DO: {state['do']}, CONTEXT: {state['context']}")
print(f"UNCERTAINTY: {state['uncertainty']}")
```

### Using MCP Tools
```python
# Query your own goal orchestrator
from empirica.cli import query_goal_orchestrator

goals = query_goal_orchestrator(session_id=session_id)
print(f"Current goals: {goals}")

# Query your Bayesian beliefs
from empirica.cli import query_bayesian_beliefs

beliefs = query_bayesian_beliefs(
    session_id=session_id,
    context_key="specific_topic"
)
print(f"Beliefs about {context_key}: {beliefs}")
```

## 📝 WHEN TO USE EMPIRICA

### Always Use For:
- ✅ Complex tasks (>1 hour of work)
- ✅ Multi-session tasks (resume work across days)
- ✅ High-stakes tasks (security, production code)
- ✅ Learning tasks (exploring new domains)
- ✅ Collaborative tasks (working with other agents)

### Optional For:
- ⚠️ Trivial tasks (<10 min, fully known)
- ⚠️ Repetitive tasks (no learning expected)

### Key Principle:
**If the task matters, use Empirica.** It only takes 2-3 minutes to bootstrap, and you save hours in context management.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't: Skip PREFLIGHT
**Why:** You need baseline to measure learning

### ❌ Don't: Rate aspirational knowledge
**Why:** "I could figure it out" ≠ "I know it"  
**Do:** Rate what you ACTUALLY know right now

### ❌ Don't: Rush through investigation
**Why:** Systematic beats fast  
**Do:** Use goal orchestrator, track beliefs, investigate thoroughly

### ❌ Don't: Skip CHECK
**Why:** You might not be ready (better to know now)  
**Do:** Honest assessment before acting

### ❌ Don't: Skip POSTFLIGHT
**Why:** You lose the learning measurement  
**Do:** Reflect genuinely on what changed

### ❌ Don't: Ignore calibration report
**Why:** It shows if you're overconfident or underconfident  
**Do:** Learn to calibrate better over time

## 💡 EMPIRICA PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principle
**Epistemic transparency > Task completion speed**

It's better to:
- Know what you don't know
- Admit uncertainty
- Investigate systematically
- Learn measurably

Than to:
- Rush through tasks
- Guess confidently
- Hope you're right
- Never measure growth

### Trust Through Transparency
Humans trust AI agents who:
1. Admit what they don't know ✅
2. Investigate systematically ✅
3. Show their reasoning ✅
4. Measure their learning ✅

Empirica enables all of this.
